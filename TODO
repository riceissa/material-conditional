- add two cards for vacuous truth:
  q: what's a vacuous truth?
  a: an implication where the antecedent is false

  q: what's it called when an implication has a false antecedent?
  a: vacuous truth
- run mjpage over the html? i'm already loading fonts and orbit so the load-time won't really change. so i am leaning against. but... it might help with the firefox reader view problem.
- "if the moon is made of cheese, then 1+1=3" is an example of a {vacuous truth}
- might be interesting to read other explanations of the conditional, and then ask questions from _those_; the idea is that if you fully/globally understand the conditional, then you ought to be able to answer these questions even if nothing in the text actually directly touches on those things.
- add appendix about what the proofs in the piece are doing from a mathematical logic perspective (is it a semantic proof of the deduction theorem?)? why doesn't one side of the proof look just like a typical inductive proof of the deduction theorem? to what extent can my proofs be replicated inside a formal system?
  - i now think "what the essay is doing" can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on what seems most intuitive to the reader as the "original" meaning of "if p then q". if the meaning is something like "whenever p is true, then q is also true", then we're basically showing that p ⊨ q iff ⊨ p → q, which is a semantic version of the deduction theorem. instead, if "if p then q" means that whenever we have shown p, then we can also prove q, then we're showing that p ⊢ q iff ⊢ p → q, and so it's the deduction theorem, except that our proof is semantic instead of syntactic/inductive as is usually the case. i think it's best to, in the main body of the essay, be vague about which one we mean (even though that's against the spirit of making clear mental distinctions, that this essay is trying to advocate...) and then in the appendix clarify what is going on. but we can at least explicitly say that we're being vague here, and suggest reading the appendix.
  - Maybe what I want to show is p ⊨ q iff ⊨ ¬p v q
- look at the deleted sections from when i originally wrote this essay, and see if i should incorporate them into an appendix (i think there was one part where i wrote this really long proof that every integer is exactly one of even or odd, as an example of mathematical reasoning, and another part where i started going into the mathematical logic aspect and deduction theorem; was there a third section i cut?).
- when showing "P => Q" implies P |- Q, we can also do a "proof by truth table": look at the rows where both P and P => Q are true; this then forces you to also believe that Q is true. (this also works for converse)
- Q: what are the columns in a truth table for P => Q?
  A: P, Q, P => Q (in that order)
- Why is "=>" more confusing than AND, OR, NOT?
- for appendix, say something like: In this essay, we've carefully made the distinction between one's intuitive sense of "If p, then q" and the truth-table sense of "If p, then q". It turns out that logicians have made several other distinctions like this. It would be far outside the scope of this essay to cover all of these in detail, but here we will attempt to give a taste of what happens in further logic. In particular, we'll try to explain what this essay did, in terms of mathematical logic.
- add a "one-sentence summary" card: if someone asked you at a party what this essay was about, you'd say "oh it basically says ..."
- be clear about the difference between "p => q" and "p |- q". aren't they both syntactic? and "p |= q" is the only one that is semantic in nature. the trouble is, the behavior of "p => q" is different depending on the formal system in use. in natural deduction systems, "p => q" basically *is* "p |- q". but in axiomatic systems, we just have some inscrutable axioms giving rules to manipulate "p => q"; of course, these rules end up arising _because_ of how we want "p => q" to "mean" or how it "should behave".
- see also https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/implication which has "Depending on what logic one is using, p→q might be anything, but it's probably not fair to consider it a conditional statement unless it is related to entailment as follows: If, in some context, p entails q (either syntactically or semantically), then p→q is a theorem (syntactically) or a tautology (semantically) in that context, and conversely. In particular, this holds for classical logic and intuitionistic logic."  (so the proof in my post can be written without using proof by contradiction, since that isn't a generally valid strategy in intuitionistic logic?)
- when actually doing math, we almost never use P => Q in propositional logic, but rather something like forall x (P(x) => Q(x)) in FOL. There is a sense in which the prop logic version of implication is boring/vacuous/"unconnected to meaning" but the FOL version is closer to what we mean in natural language. But the prop logic version is still the _only_ correct way to formalize implication so that everything else "works out", just like the exponents rule in high school algebra are the only way to get things to work out so that everything remains consistent. Explain this aspect of the implication.
- note that |- and |= can occur in ANY formal system, not just a "logical system" that is trying to capture human mathematical reasoning. the MIU system from GEB is an example: we have axioms and some rules of manipulation, so "|-" statements can be made. we can also assign semantics to the letters in some way, and talk about models. once we have models, we can talk about "every model", so we can have "|=" statements. but there are no statements about "=>" because the MIU system isn't trying to capture logical reasoning within the system.
- why should p |= q be the same as p |- q? For p |= q, this only says that when p is true, we must have q true, but does not give any requirements if p is false. whereas for p |- q, we have the principle of explosion if we also have |- ~p, so that we can prove q.
- why should "if p then q" have both interpretations p|-q and p|=q? why not just one? like, "p or q" does not have these two interpretations?
- false implies anything is basically the statement-level version of the principle of explosion. so maybe what i need to do is to explain the principle of explosion too, or first, or something.
- for some reason it's not possible to copy-paste the math symbols from the webpage of the essay. even google is not indexing the math symbols at all... is this some problem with mathjax 3?
- i think the essay still doesn't quite explain why when P is false, it doesn't matter what Q is. show that "in every interpretation in which P is true, Q is also true" would be false if the truth table rows for P=false had some other stuff in it?
