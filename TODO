- might be interesting to read other explanations of the conditional, and then ask questions from _those_; the idea is that if you fully/globally understand the conditional, then you ought to be able to answer these questions even if nothing in the text actually directly touches on those things.
- add appendix about what the proofs in the piece are doing from a mathematical logic perspective (is it a semantic proof of the deduction theorem?)? why doesn't one side of the proof look just like a typical inductive proof of the deduction theorem? to what extent can my proofs be replicated inside a formal system?
  - i now think "what the essay is doing" can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on what seems most intuitive to the reader as the "original" meaning of "if p then q". if the meaning is something like "whenever p is true, then q is also true", then we're basically showing that p |= q iff |= p → q, which is a semantic version of the deduction theorem. instead, if "if p then q" means that whenever we have shown p, then we can also prove q, then we're showing that p |- q iff |- p → q, and so it's the deduction theorem, except that our proof is semantic instead of syntactic/inductive as is usually the case. i think it's best to, in the main body of the essay, be vague about which one we mean (even though that's against the spirit of making clear mental distinctions, that this essay is trying to advocate...) and then in the appendix clarify what is going on. but we can at least explicitly say that we're being vague here, and suggest reading the appendix.
    actually, i now think that what the essay is doing is to, in a natural deduction system, show that ~pvq |- p->q and p->q |- ~pvq. If we then allow that ~pvq has the typical truth table/semantics, then this will mean that (after we have soundness/completeness) p->q will also have the typical truth table/semantics.
  - Maybe what I want to show is p |= q iff |= ¬p v q
  - two other ideas, from https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/LogicStudyGuide.pdf#page=104
    - we are showing that (~A v B) |- (A -> B) as well as (A -> B) |- (~A v B).
    - we are showing all four rows of the truth table by proving all of: A,B |- (A -> B); A,~B |- ~(A->B); ~A |- (A->B).
- look at the deleted sections from when i originally wrote this essay, and see if i should incorporate them into an appendix (i think there was one part where i wrote this really long proof that every integer is exactly one of even or odd, as an example of mathematical reasoning, and another part where i started going into the mathematical logic aspect and deduction theorem; was there a third section i cut?).
- when showing "P => Q" implies P |- Q, we can also do a "proof by truth table": look at the rows where both P and P => Q are true; this then forces you to also believe that Q is true. (this also works for converse)
- Q: what are the columns in a truth table for P => Q?
  A: P, Q, P => Q (in that order)
- Why is "=>" more confusing than AND, OR, NOT?
- for appendix, say something like: In this essay, we've carefully made the distinction between one's intuitive sense of "If p, then q" and the truth-table sense of "If p, then q". It turns out that logicians have made several other distinctions like this. It would be far outside the scope of this essay to cover all of these in detail, but here we will attempt to give a taste of what happens in further logic. In particular, we'll try to explain what this essay did, in terms of mathematical logic.
- add a "one-sentence summary" card: if someone asked you at a party what this essay was about, you'd say "oh it basically says ..."
- be clear about the difference between "p => q" and "p |- q". aren't they both syntactic? and "p |= q" is the only one that is semantic in nature. the trouble is, the behavior of "p => q" is different depending on the formal system in use. in natural deduction systems, "p => q" basically *is* "p |- q". but in axiomatic systems, we just have some inscrutable axioms giving rules to manipulate "p => q"; of course, these rules end up arising _because_ of how we want "p => q" to "mean" or how it "should behave".
- see also https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/implication which has "Depending on what logic one is using, p→q might be anything, but it's probably not fair to consider it a conditional statement unless it is related to entailment as follows: If, in some context, p entails q (either syntactically or semantically), then p→q is a theorem (syntactically) or a tautology (semantically) in that context, and conversely. In particular, this holds for classical logic and intuitionistic logic."  (so the proof in my post can be written without using proof by contradiction, since that isn't a generally valid strategy in intuitionistic logic?)
- when actually doing math, we almost never use P => Q in propositional logic, but rather something like forall x (P(x) => Q(x)) in FOL. There is a sense in which the prop logic version of implication is boring/vacuous/"unconnected to meaning" but the FOL version is closer to what we mean in natural language. But the prop logic version is still the _only_ correct way to formalize implication so that everything else "works out", just like the exponents rule in high school algebra are the only way to get things to work out so that everything remains consistent. Explain this aspect of the implication.
- note that |- and |= can occur in ANY formal system, not just a "logical system" that is trying to capture human mathematical reasoning. the MIU system from GEB is an example: we have axioms and some rules of manipulation, so "|-" statements can be made. we can also assign semantics to the letters in some way, and talk about models. once we have models, we can talk about "every model", so we can have "|=" statements. but there are no statements about "=>" because the MIU system isn't trying to capture logical reasoning within the system.
- why should p |= q be the same as p |- q? For p |= q, this only says that when p is true, we must have q true, but does not give any requirements if p is false. whereas for p |- q, we have the principle of explosion if we also have |- ~p, so that we can prove q.
- why should "if p then q" have both interpretations p|-q and p|=q? why not just one? like, "p or q" does not have these two interpretations?
- false implies anything is basically the statement-level version of the principle of explosion. so maybe what i need to do is to explain the principle of explosion too, or first, or something.
- for some reason it's not possible to copy-paste the math symbols from the webpage of the essay. even google is not indexing the math symbols at all... is this some problem with mathjax 3?
- i think the essay still doesn't quite explain why when P is false, it doesn't matter what Q is. show that "in every interpretation in which P is true, Q is also true" would be false if the truth table rows for P=false had some other stuff in it?
- if i don't already say this at the end, make sure to say that this "treat math as a mechanical thing, treat it as an object of study in itself (rather than studying other objects like spheres or whatever)" is taken much further in mathematical logic.
- it's almost like we have both a semantics and a syntactic derivation type thing for "if... then...". but then, what's up with the implication in the object-language? well we want that because we are modeling mathematical discourse/argumentation. problem is, we have two "intuitive ways of thinking" about the thing, but only one connective symbol for it! so there has to be a choice that gets made here, of which thing -> is trying to model.
- there's also this weird thing that i think i've only seen tim gowers discuss, which is that a propositional "if P then Q" basically never happens in math. you're almost always doing instead the predicate logic "for all x, if P(x) then Q(x)" instead.
- semantic entailment is more "primitive" or "prior" in some sense b/c syntactic derivation supposes some sort of deductive system/rules of inference to be laid out.
- we need to distinguish between:
  1. a logically valid argument with false premises.
  2. a vacuously logically valid argument (premises are logically false, not just false in the "real world"). e.g. from https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf#page=57 "Jack is married. Jack is not married. So the world will end tomorrow!"
  3. a conditional with false antecedent.
  4. and, i guess, a conditional with logically false antecedent?
- logic books like https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf do this weird thing where they start with informal logic using characters like "jill". then when they transition to formal logic, they basically translate these arguments about jill into propositional atoms and logical connectives. Even velleman's book does this where it takes ordinary english deductive arguments about jane and bill or w/e and then translates that to using letters, and then introduces logical connectives, and then introduces truth tables. an argument's validity is explained semantically, and "proved" using truth tables. The thing is, this is a very different thing from what mathematical logic does, which is to create a purely syntactic formal system, with axioms and rules of inference, and then show that this matches our intuitive usage of mathematical english by proving soundness and completeness.
- clarify the audience a little more: it's for people itching to get started with proof-based math. knowing some basic propositional/first-order logic is helpful to this, and they get exposed to it a bit. but the truth table of the conditional is just plain confusing! that's where i was, and that's who i want to write for.  peter smith's audience for IFL seems kind of absurd, oriented more towards ... philosophy majors ... or something? i don't give a damn about jack and jill or whether babies can manage crocodiles. in fact, i should probably pull out the "moon is made of cheese" example and substitute a purely mathematical example. i think daniel velleman (_how to prove it_), tim gowers (his intro logic blog posts), and joseph rotman (journey into maths) had the right idea/audience here.
- pre-theoratically, how do we know when to trust an argument? both smith and velleman seem to use the "if there is no interpretation/truth-assignment in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false" thing. but i'm not sure that's actually what is going on in most people's minds... If we *are* taking this semantics-first approach, then it seems like what we want to show is that there exists a connective * such that |= P*Q if and only if P |= Q. None of this "let's see what the truth table of P->Q should be" crap.
  but really, i think the idea of a "logically valid" argument is itself a kind of "you know it when you see it", thing rather something that i pre-theoretically define as "there is no interpretation in which the premises are true and the conclusion false".
  So why _do_ i believe the following argument is valid?
    P or Q
    not-Q
    therefore, P
  it's almost like the above is obviously true. if that's the case, a syntactic natural deduction system seems like actually the more intuitive approach than the semantics-first approach!
- i almost want to develop a typology of explanations of the material conditional. is it a semantics-first approach? is it a syntax-first approach? etc. if syntax-first, you have the choice of natural deduction vs axiomatic.
  the syntax-first approach maybe runs into problems when we talk about truth tables... you need to assign meaning. and you can't just say "it's true if you can prove it", since truth and provability are distinct notions. the syntactic approach *feels* more natural to me but it's arguably the wrong approach since it risks confusing truth and provability (by having the natural deduction rules, you're starting to talk about what we can prove, but in fact you're also like informally talking about what's true by saying things like "if P is true ..."). I think I maybe need to first talk about this distinction in the essay itself, or maybe an appendix.
  so actually, while peter smith's IFL and velleman's book take the semantics-first approach, GEB takes the syntax-first approach!
- so the goal of the main essay should still be to connect the "intuitive" notion of conditional with the truth table definition. but, what i'm realizing now is that there is more than one "intuitive" notion.
- if it's not already in the essay: emphasize that the only reason the material conditional is hard is that _you already have opinions_ about it. you have an intuitive notion. if we defined a new connective called * and defined P*Q according to the truth table of the material conditional (without using that term), you might be confused why it's an interesting connective to study, but you wouldn't be thinking it is *unintuitive*. things are unintuitive when you have a pre-existing intuition about the thing. so let's find out what your preexisting intuition is, and try to make it rigorous.
- do the zero margins thing i did on my personal website. (when making window narrower, the gray background should completely disappear after a while)
- make sure to say that in this essay we are only considering "if...then..." as it is used in mathematics. so we don't consider things like counterfactual "if"s, possible-worlds, subjunctive, whatever.
- section 22.3 in smith's book is very important https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf#page=216
- if it's not already there, explain the connection to False |- anything.
- many explanations, (e.g. pointing to how (P ^ Q) -> P should be a tautology; three of the lines in the truth table for this show that T->T, F->T and F->F; see https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3467187/35525 for details) just start by assuming that -> can be captured by a truth table! maybe mention this at the start of my essay.
  also a similar reasoning should show that P -> ~P is false no matter what!
- idea for appendix 2: a comprehensive list of all the *other* explanations of the material conditional and why i don't like them.
- i kinda like https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1623400/35525 even though it also assumes you can write it in a truth table.
- i feel like the moon is cheese stuff is still kinda maybe not convincing. i think i need to flesh out the connection with "ex falso quodlibet"/principle of explosion more as well.
- explain more the analogies with valid arguments. "if p then q" is analogous to "p; therefore q".
- go back and reread my question here to incorporate any insights: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/4281589/does-the-following-proof-work-for-a-special-case-of-the-deduction-theorem
- also fix up this answer: https://matheducators.stackexchange.com/a/24369/9917 which was written before i had some of my recent realizations
- talk about how, since the premise of a vacuous implication will never show up, it's not like we can conclude anything absurd anyway.
- make a point that usually when ppl think of "mindless computational stuff", they think purely of syntax. but here, we actually got more computational results using semantics (truth tables). in particular, exhaustive listing of truth table rows can sometimes be the easiest/most mindless way to show that something is a tautology.
- maybe say more about how the modus ponens/conditional proof version of conditional is "active/dynamic" whereas truth table is "passive/static".
- My aim with this piece was not to show that the material conditional corresponds to ordinary English usage of "if ..., then ...". Instead, I wanted to show that it corresponds to how mathematicians use "if ..., then ...", by showing that if one accepts that "if ..., then ..." obeys modus ponens and conditional proof (which I think are pretty obvious/a lot easier for beginners to accept than the truth table of the conditional), as well as some other apparatus of classical logic, then one is forced to a truth-functional conditional. I think beginners to writing proofs don't really care if the "if ..., then ..." in math can capture all of the complexities of ordinary English, but they do care that the "if ..., then ..." they have been using in proofs is the same as the truth table version. Does that make sense? If so I'll make some edits to make that point a bit clearer. If there's still a disagreement I'd like to hear more.
- A lot of other explanations use this approach, but I don't find it convincing because a separate argument needs to be given for why we should expect the conditional to be truth-functional in the first place, and no one seems to explain why that should be the case (other than giving cop-out responses like "it's convenient"). So the goal I have with the piece is a bit more ambitious, in that I want to justify why the conditional is truth-functional and that it corresponds to the material conditional. [however, it's also *less* ambitious due to the point i made in the previous point, which is that i'm not trying to say anything about how the conditional in math is identical to the usage of "if... then..." in ordinary language.]
- it's possible to run through the truth table by invoking MP or CP. for P=T, Q=T, you use CP by saying suppose P is true. then we know that Q is true. therefore, if P then Q. For P=F, you say, suppose P is true. but P is false. a contradiction. therefore, anything follows, including Q. For P=T, Q=F, you use MP. suppose "if P then Q" is true. then use MP to show that Q is true. But Q is false! so "if P then Q" must have been false.
- also possible to run through the proof but show the conditions for not-P or Q
- stuff from meeting:
  - talk about lewis carroll's tortoise and achilles / circularity of defining logic. might want to link to my old question https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/173735/how-to-avoid-perceived-circularity-when-defining-a-formal-language as well as eliezer's posts about "minds need to be created in motion" / "you can't teach logic to a rock" / "the buck has to stop somewhere".
  - when using "if and only if" in theorem, make sure to say that it's part of the metalanguage.  but the thing in the metalanguage also follows the same rules as the "if ... then ..." that we intuitive think of in the object language, i.e. MP and CP.
  - did not find MP and CP "intuitively obvious". part of the issue was the lewis carroll thing above. i think she was more on board after i explained that. the point of logic is to keep assumptions to a minimum, even if we can't make it zero.
  - said my old explanation of distinguishing |- and -> was actually helpful. maybe i should introduce the notation |- into the main essay.
- there's a bit of a tricky thing going on here where some books use -> to mean the intuitive conditional, and then show that -> works the same as not-p-or-q. whereas other books just define -> to be the material conditional, and then they try to show that -> is the same as the intuitive "if...then...". maybe mention this in like a footnote.

- That's a quite interesting point... I do admit that some people will be similar to you. And I do agree that learning about propositional logic will help people write more correct mathematical proofs (this is kind of what I was getting at in the "Why propositional logic?" section). But my counter-point would be something like: propositional logic in its modern form only came about in the mid-1800s or so, and mathematicians were writing rigorous proofs before then, without any conception of truth tables. So it does seem not only possible but also quite natural to be writing proofs in a sort of "intuitive" way, at least at first, and then later refine this understanding using tools like truth tables.
- You're right that conditional proof and modus ponens alone are not sufficient to prove the equivalence with the truth table definition. That's why I wrote "as well as some other apparatus of classical logic" in my previous message. I think the proof in my essay would almost but not quite work in intuitionistic logic (you'd have to insert some double-negations in the appropriate places, I think), for example. I don't know how unusual this is, but personally I had no problem accepting things like law of excluded middle and other features of classical logic -- it really was just the truth table of the conditional that confused me a ton.
- "also, I felt that in order to appreciate your reasoning in the argument one has to be fine with the fact that A->B is equivalent to ~A or B." -- I would appreciate being pointed to the exact spot(s) in my proof where you think this happening. (I do agree with a more general point that one has to be at least a bit comfortable with proofs to understand my essay, so a bit of circularity does creep in).

- Here's one way I look at the principle of explosion (which is I think what you are referring to when you say "vacuous arguments"): We want to start with some contradiction, like "P and not-P" and derive an arbitrary statement Q. Since P is true, we know that "P or Q" is true. But since not-P is true, the first alternative cannot be, so we are left with Q. It's a silly argument, but it somehow gets me to be like "ok yeah, I guess if we allow contradictions then we'd be able to make silly arguments like this to show anything at all".
- So there's two ways to approach what '=>' means. One way is to define it according to the truth table, then show that "P => Q" matches that "intuitive" meaning of "if P, then Q" (i.e. a statement following MP and CP). That's what I was trying to get at there, by defining "P => Q" as the same as "¬PvQ" (but then not using the former notation because it seemed confusing). The other way is to let "P => Q" be a connective that obeys MP and CP (i.e. we define '=>' to mean the intuitive "if ... then ..."), then show that this has a truth table equivalent to "¬PvQ". If that makes sense, I'll make some edits to make this clearer.
- in some parts of the essays i use 'conditional' to mean 'our intutivie understanding of the conditional' whereas in other parts i use it to mean 'the material conditional as defined formally'.  The point of the essay is to show they are one and the same, but it's not a priori clear from the start, so make sure to clarify this in the beginning.

here's maybe another way to think about what to put in the essay: ask what the most important insights i have about the conditional, and then write the orbit cards _first_. Then, find some structure/outline that would accomodate those cards.
- what's the connection between the principle of explosion and a vacuous implication?
  a vacuous implication is a "sentence form" of the principle of explosion; alternatively, the principle of explosion is an "argument form" of a vacuous implicaiton.
- in natural deduction, what's the way to *use* a conditional sentence?
  modus ponens
- in natural deduction, what's the way to *create* a conditional sentence?
  conditional proof
- what's a one-sentence summary of why the truth table of material conditional makes sense? (need better prompt for this)
  a logical connective that obeys both MP and CP automatically has the material conditional truth table
- why is the conditional truth-functional?
  there's a lot of different ansewrs that can be given here... One is that it's because we proved it! We might get more philosophical though, and ask why the proof was possible. Maybe it's that classical logic (mathematical reasoning) is "rigid" enough that things like vacuous truth/law of excluded middle are all true, and in that setting false implies anything. Kinda related: https://twitter.com/QiaochuYuan/status/1527334796900245504 esp this part: "i do think though that the principle of explosion correctly points towards the consequences of holding a false belief sufficiently *rigidly* and *globally*. if there's a thing you've decided is always good or always bad, and you're committed to ignoring exceptions then the principle of explosion suggests, correctly imo, that there's no upper limit to how insane your beliefs or your behavior can get, starting from that false, rigid, global premise. the more universally and rigidly you apply your pet falsehood the worse things get"
- why do silly implications like "if 1+1=5 then the riemann hypothesis is true" or "if 1+1=2 then fermat's last theorem is true" not cause a problem in practice?
  If you've found a contradiction, then you should not be using that system. In real life you're only going to be arguing from a contradictory assumption in a proof by contradiction where you can't yet use the fact that a thing is false. Also if the consequent is true, then you must already have some sort of proof (ignoring godelian stuff) so you're not really going to be talking about implications involving it. idk i feel like there's a lot more that could be said here.
  Also mathematicians have a way to explore which theorems are provable without using certain results (e.g. see reverse mathematics and stuff in mathematical logic where you try to see how strong certain axioms are). There are also "alternative proofs" of therems.. which is a bit harder to formalize.

- why are the people who say "this is just a definition, get used to it" wrong?
  a: it's because in this case, the problem isn't that there's just one way => is used in math, there are two! what's needed is to bridge that gap.
