- add two cards for vacuous truth:
  q: what's a vacuous truth?
  a: an implication where the antecedent is false

  q: what's it called when an implication has a false antecedent?
  a: vacuous truth
- "if the moon is made of cheese, then 1+1=3" is an example of a {vacuous truth}
- might be interesting to read other explanations of the conditional, and then ask questions from _those_; the idea is that if you fully/globally understand the conditional, then you ought to be able to answer these questions even if nothing in the text actually directly touches on those things.
- add appendix about what the proofs in the piece are doing from a mathematical logic perspective (is it a semantic proof of the deduction theorem?)? why doesn't one side of the proof look just like a typical inductive proof of the deduction theorem? to what extent can my proofs be replicated inside a formal system?
  - i now think "what the essay is doing" can be interpreted in multiple ways, depending on what seems most intuitive to the reader as the "original" meaning of "if p then q". if the meaning is something like "whenever p is true, then q is also true", then we're basically showing that p ⊨ q iff ⊨ p → q, which is a semantic version of the deduction theorem. instead, if "if p then q" means that whenever we have shown p, then we can also prove q, then we're showing that p ⊢ q iff ⊢ p → q, and so it's the deduction theorem, except that our proof is semantic instead of syntactic/inductive as is usually the case. i think it's best to, in the main body of the essay, be vague about which one we mean (even though that's against the spirit of making clear mental distinctions, that this essay is trying to advocate...) and then in the appendix clarify what is going on. but we can at least explicitly say that we're being vague here, and suggest reading the appendix.
    actually, i now think that what the essay is doing is to, in a natural deduction system, show that ~pvq |- p->q and p->q |- ~pvq. If we then allow that ~pvq has the typical truth table/semantics, then this will mean that (after we have soundness/completeness) p->q will also have the typical truth table/semantics.
  - Maybe what I want to show is p ⊨ q iff ⊨ ¬p v q
  - two other ideas, from https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/LogicStudyGuide.pdf#page=104
    - we are showing that (~A v B) |- (A -> B) as well as (A -> B) |- (~A v B).
    - we are showing all four rows of the truth table by proving all of: A,B |- (A -> B); A,~B |- ~(A->B); ~A |- (A->B).
- look at the deleted sections from when i originally wrote this essay, and see if i should incorporate them into an appendix (i think there was one part where i wrote this really long proof that every integer is exactly one of even or odd, as an example of mathematical reasoning, and another part where i started going into the mathematical logic aspect and deduction theorem; was there a third section i cut?).
- when showing "P => Q" implies P |- Q, we can also do a "proof by truth table": look at the rows where both P and P => Q are true; this then forces you to also believe that Q is true. (this also works for converse)
- Q: what are the columns in a truth table for P => Q?
  A: P, Q, P => Q (in that order)
- Why is "=>" more confusing than AND, OR, NOT?
- for appendix, say something like: In this essay, we've carefully made the distinction between one's intuitive sense of "If p, then q" and the truth-table sense of "If p, then q". It turns out that logicians have made several other distinctions like this. It would be far outside the scope of this essay to cover all of these in detail, but here we will attempt to give a taste of what happens in further logic. In particular, we'll try to explain what this essay did, in terms of mathematical logic.
- add a "one-sentence summary" card: if someone asked you at a party what this essay was about, you'd say "oh it basically says ..."
- be clear about the difference between "p => q" and "p |- q". aren't they both syntactic? and "p |= q" is the only one that is semantic in nature. the trouble is, the behavior of "p => q" is different depending on the formal system in use. in natural deduction systems, "p => q" basically *is* "p |- q". but in axiomatic systems, we just have some inscrutable axioms giving rules to manipulate "p => q"; of course, these rules end up arising _because_ of how we want "p => q" to "mean" or how it "should behave".
- see also https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/implication which has "Depending on what logic one is using, p→q might be anything, but it's probably not fair to consider it a conditional statement unless it is related to entailment as follows: If, in some context, p entails q (either syntactically or semantically), then p→q is a theorem (syntactically) or a tautology (semantically) in that context, and conversely. In particular, this holds for classical logic and intuitionistic logic."  (so the proof in my post can be written without using proof by contradiction, since that isn't a generally valid strategy in intuitionistic logic?)
- when actually doing math, we almost never use P => Q in propositional logic, but rather something like forall x (P(x) => Q(x)) in FOL. There is a sense in which the prop logic version of implication is boring/vacuous/"unconnected to meaning" but the FOL version is closer to what we mean in natural language. But the prop logic version is still the _only_ correct way to formalize implication so that everything else "works out", just like the exponents rule in high school algebra are the only way to get things to work out so that everything remains consistent. Explain this aspect of the implication.
- note that |- and |= can occur in ANY formal system, not just a "logical system" that is trying to capture human mathematical reasoning. the MIU system from GEB is an example: we have axioms and some rules of manipulation, so "|-" statements can be made. we can also assign semantics to the letters in some way, and talk about models. once we have models, we can talk about "every model", so we can have "|=" statements. but there are no statements about "=>" because the MIU system isn't trying to capture logical reasoning within the system.
- why should p |= q be the same as p |- q? For p |= q, this only says that when p is true, we must have q true, but does not give any requirements if p is false. whereas for p |- q, we have the principle of explosion if we also have |- ~p, so that we can prove q.
- why should "if p then q" have both interpretations p|-q and p|=q? why not just one? like, "p or q" does not have these two interpretations?
- false implies anything is basically the statement-level version of the principle of explosion. so maybe what i need to do is to explain the principle of explosion too, or first, or something.
- for some reason it's not possible to copy-paste the math symbols from the webpage of the essay. even google is not indexing the math symbols at all... is this some problem with mathjax 3?
- i think the essay still doesn't quite explain why when P is false, it doesn't matter what Q is. show that "in every interpretation in which P is true, Q is also true" would be false if the truth table rows for P=false had some other stuff in it?
- if i don't already say this at the end, make sure to say that this "treat math as a mechanical thing, treat it as an object of study in itself (rather than studying other objects like spheres or whatever)" is taken much further in mathematical logic.
- it's almost like we have both a semantics and a syntactic derivation type thing for "if... then...". but then, what's up with the implication in the object-language? well we want that because we are modeling mathematical discourse/argumentation. problem is, we have two "intuitive ways of thinking" about the thing, but only one connective symbol for it! so there has to be a choice that gets made here, of which thing -> is trying to model.
- there's also this weird thing that i think i've only seen tim gowers discuss, which is that a propositional "if P then Q" basically never happens in math. you're almost always doing instead the predicate logic "for all x, if P(x) then Q(x)" instead.
- semantic entailment is more "primitive" or "prior" in some sense b/c syntactic derivation supposes some sort of deductive system/rules of inference to be laid out.
- we need to distinguish between:
  1. a logically valid argument with false premises.
  2. a vacuously logically valid argument (premises are logically false, not just false in the "real world"). e.g. from https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf#page=57 "Jack is married. Jack is not married. So the world will end tomorrow!"
  3. a conditional with false antecedent.
  4. and, i guess, a conditional with logically false antecedent?
- logic books like https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf do this weird thing where they start with informal logic using characters like "jill". then when they transition to formal logic, they basically translate these arguments about jill into propositional atoms and logical connectives. Even velleman's book does this where it takes ordinary english deductive arguments about jane and bill or w/e and then translates that to using letters, and then introduces logical connectives, and then introduces truth tables. an argument's validity is explained semantically, and "proved" using truth tables. The thing is, this is a very different thing from what mathematical logic does, which is to create a purely syntactic formal system, with axioms and rules of inference, and then show that this matches our intuitive usage of mathematical english by proving soundness and completeness.
- clarify the audience a little more: it's for people itching to get started with proof-based math. knowing some basic propositional/first-order logic is helpful to this, and they get exposed to it a bit. but the truth table of the conditional is just plain confusing! that's where i was, and that's who i want to write for.  peter smith's audience for IFL seems kind of absurd, oriented more towards ... philosophy majors ... or something? i don't give a damn about jack and jill or whether babies can manage crocodiles. in fact, i should probably pull out the "moon is made of cheese" example and substitute a purely mathematical example. i think daniel velleman (_how to prove it_), tim gowers (his intro logic blog posts), and joseph rotman (journey into maths) had the right idea/audience here.
- pre-theoratically, how do we know when to trust an argument? both smith and velleman seem to use the "if there is no interpretation/truth-assignment in which the premises are true and the conclusion is false" thing. but i'm not sure that's actually what is going on in most people's minds... If we *are* taking this semantics-first approach, then it seems like what we want to show is that there exists a connective * such that |= P*Q if and only if P |= Q. None of this "let's see what the truth table of P->Q should be" crap.
  but really, i think the idea of a "logically valid" argument is itself a kind of "you know it when you see it", thing rather something that i pre-theoretically define as "there is no interpretation in which the premises are true and the conclusion false".
  So why _do_ i believe the following argument is valid?
    P or Q
    not-Q
    therefore, P
  it's almost like the above is obviously true. if that's the case, a syntactic natural deduction system seems like actually the more intuitive approach than the semantics-first approach!
- i almost want to develop a typology of explanations of the material conditional. is it a semantics-first approach? is it a syntax-first approach? etc. if syntax-first, you have the choice of natural deduction vs axiomatic.
  the syntax-first approach maybe runs into problems when we talk about truth tables... you need to assign meaning. and you can't just say "it's true if you can prove it", since truth and provability are distinct notions. the syntactic approach *feels* more natural to me but it's arguably the wrong approach since it risks confusing truth and provability (by having the natural deduction rules, you're starting to talk about what we can prove, but in fact you're also like informally talking about what's true by saying things like "if P is true ..."). I think I maybe need to first talk about this distinction in the essay itself, or maybe an appendix.
  so actually, while peter smith's IFL and velleman's book take the semantics-first approach, GEB takes the syntax-first approach!
- so the goal of the main essay should still be to connect the "intuitive" notion of conditional with the truth table definition. but, what i'm realizing now is that there is more than one "intuitive" notion.
- if it's not already in the essay: emphasize that the only reason the material conditional is hard is that _you already have opinions_ about it. you have an intuitive notion. if we defined a new connective called * and defined P*Q according to the truth table of the material conditional (without using that term), you might be confused why it's an interesting connective to study, but you wouldn't be thinking it is *unintuitive*. things are unintuitive when you have a pre-existing intuition about the thing. so let's find out what your preexisting intuition is, and try to make it rigorous.
- do the zero margins thing i did on my personal website. (when making window narrower, the gray background should completely disappear after a while)
- make sure to say that in this essay we are only considering "if...then..." as it is used in mathematics. so we don't consider things like counterfactual "if"s, possible-worlds, subjunctive, whatever.
- section 22.3 in smith's book is very important https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf#page=216
- if it's not already there, explain the connection to False |- anything.
- many explanations, (e.g. pointing to how (P ^ Q) -> P should be a tautology; three of the lines in the truth table for this show that T->T, F->T and F->F; see https://math.stackexchange.com/a/3467187/35525 for details) just start by assuming that -> can be captured by a truth table! maybe mention this at the start of my essay.
  also a similar reasoning should show that P -> ~P is false no matter what!
- idea for appendix 2: a comprehensive list of all the *other* explanations of the material conditional and why i don't like them.
- i kinda like https://math.stackexchange.com/a/1623400/35525 even though it also assumes you can write it in a truth table.
