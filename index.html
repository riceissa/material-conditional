      <h2 id="intro">Introduction and audience for this piece
        <a href="#intro" class="heading-marker">#</a>
        <a href="#toc" class="heading-marker">↩︎</a></h2>

      <p>In this post we will explore the truth table of
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional">material
      conditional</a> (i.e., the “if&nbsp;&hellip;,
      then&nbsp;&hellip;” statement used in math). Students first
      learning formal logic or getting started with writing proofs are
      introduced to the idea of truth tables along with the usual
      logical connectives like \(\lnot\) (NOT), \(\land\) (AND), and
      \(\lor\) (OR). Everything goes well until the logical connective
      \(\implies\) (IMPLIES) for the material conditional is
      introduced. Why does a false statement imply everything? This is
      usually explained quite poorly, e.g., in terms of promises: a
      false antecedent means the condition of the promise never
      arises, so one automatically keeps the promise.</p>

      <!-- TODO: probably needs an example of a promise, to make this more concrete -->

      <p>As a beginner to math, I spent many <em>years</em> being
      confused about this. Just to give one aspect of my confusion,
      the explanation in terms of promises didn’t make sense because
      while it is true that one didn’t break the promise when the
      antecedent is false, it’s also not clear that one has actually
      kept the promise, or that one <em>would have</em> kept the
      promise. It also seemed suspicious that we were picking one
      specific way in which “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;” was
      used in natural language and ignoring all the others. Why were
      we allowed to pick one specific meaning to use for
      “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;”? But then again, I didn’t
      have the same problem with the logical OR connective: it always
      meant
      the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/InclusiveDisjunction.html">inclusive
      OR</a> in math, and I was fine to accept that. So why was I so
      confused about the material conditional? It seemed like I was
      not only confused about the truth table, but also, inside my own
      mind, confused about <em>why</em> I was confused; I had trouble
      articulating my own confusion.</p>

      <p>Like many students of math, I eventually decided to accept
      the usual truth table without understanding it because it just
      seemed to work. Many years later, I eventually hit upon the core
      of my confusion, and also a way to resolve this confusion. This
      is what I’d like to explain in this post.</p>

      <p>In keeping with the above, the audience for this post is
      someone who has written some proofs before and has seen
      propositional logic and truth tables, but who still feels
      confused why the truth table for the material conditional is the
      way it is.</p>

      <p>Finally, one small terminological note: in this post I use
      “material conditional”, “conditional”, and “implication”
      interchangeably. In some contexts people distinguish the
      “material” conditional from other kinds of conditionals, and in
      such places these terms can’t be used interchangeably, but we
      will not be encountering any other conditionals in this post, so
      it is safe to switch around if one sounds more natural than the
      others.</p>

      <h2 id="material-conditional">The material conditional
        <a href="#material-conditional" class="heading-marker">#</a>
        <a href="#toc" class="heading-marker">↩︎</a></h2>

      <p>So why does the conditional statement \(P \implies Q\) have
      the truth table that it does? In order to answer this question,
      let’s think about what makes implication different from the
      other logical connectives like NOT, AND, and OR. After all, we
      have no problem with the other connectives so there must
      be <em>some</em> difference we can identify. And, in my opinion,
      it is this difference that makes people so uncomfortable about
      the truth table for the conditional. If you feel so inclined, I
      think this is a good exercise to attempt before reading on. It
      will give you practice peeking into your own mind and trying to
      pinpoint a subtle distinction your mind is making.</p>

      <p>Now, for a logical connective like OR, there is no debate
      about whether it can be represented as a binary operation on the
      truth values of sentences. Sure, we might debate whether our
      “or” should be inclusive or exclusive, but in either case, it is
      clear that this concept can be represented as one of two columns
      in a truth table:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>\(P\)</th> <th>\(Q\)</th> <th>\(P\) inclusive-or \(Q\)</th> <th>\(P\) exclusive-or \(Q\)</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The same cannot be said for the conditional statement! It is
      true that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is a statement involving \(P\)
      and \(Q\), which we presume has some truth value. But is this
      statement really a function of the <em>truth values</em> of
      \(P\) and \(Q\)? Or could it depend on the <em>contents</em> of
      \(P\) and \(Q\)?</p>

      <p>Let me stress this point by bringing in an unrelated example:
      Consider two functions, \(f\) and \(g\), both defined on pairs
      of numbers. We define \(f(x,y) = \operatorname{sgn}(xy)\), where
      \(\operatorname{sgn}\) is
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function">sign
      function</a> that returns \(1\) when a number is positive, \(0\)
      when it is the number \(0\), and \(-1\) when a number is
      negative. We define \(g(x,y) = xy\) to be the product of the two
      numbers. Thus for example \(f(-2,3) = -1\) and \(g(-2,3) = -6\).
      It can be shown that \(\operatorname{sgn}(xy) =
      \operatorname{sgn}(x)\operatorname{sgn}(y)\), so the value of
      \(f\) depends only on the sign of the inputs. This is analogous
      to how the OR connective depends only on the truth values of the
      input statements. On the other hand, the value of \(g\) depends
      on the actual values of the inputs, not just the sign. In an
      analogous way, a statement involving two other statements may
      depend on just the truth values of the input statements, or it
      may depend more specifically on the contents of the input
      statements.</p>

      <p>A logical connective can only be represented in a truth table
      if it depends solely on the truth values of the inputs. So at
      the moment it is not clear whether the conditional statement can
      actually be represented in a truth table.</p>

      <p>We can make the above point in a slightly different way: As
      humans, we tend to <em>conflate</em> similar-seeming things in
      order to simplify our thinking. But in math, it is important to
      pay attention to one’s mental representations of things and to
      not conflate things that are actually meaningfully distinct.
      This sort of thing happens in mathematics all the time. We
      might, for example, introduce a relation called \(\leq\) on some
      class of objects. But just because it looks like an inequality,
      we cannot assume that it is reflexive or transitive or has any
      of the properties we normally associate with an inequality
      relation! A mathematician has to think very carefully to avoid
      this kind of conflation.</p>

      <p>Looking at the statement “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”, we currently
      have two different mental models of it:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The mysterious new meaning textbooks are forcing on us:
        The logical connective \(\implies\), which takes two sentences
        and turns them into a third sentence with a specific truth
        value, as described by the truth table.</li>

        <li>A much more familiar meaning: As a rule of inference
        saying that once we have \(P\), we are allowed to have
        \(Q\).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Intuitively, we think of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” as a rule
      telling us that whenever in an argument we’ve shown \(P\) to be
      true, then we also get to say that \(Q\) is true. <em>A
      priori</em>, this has very little to do with the statement \(P
      \implies Q\) as defined by the truth table! This is just another
      way of stating that we aren’t sure yet whether our intuitive
      notion of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” can be represented in a truth
      table.</p>

      <p>So, <em>are</em> these two meanings of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”
      related? It turns out, there is a very satisfying connection: we
      can make the inference from \(P\) to \(Q\) exactly when the
      statement \(P \implies Q\) is true. In other words, our
      intuitive notion of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” coincides perfectly
      with the truth-table definition of implication!</p>

      <p>“Huh?” you might say. “How could our intuitive notion
      coincide with the truth table one? Didn’t we go on at length in
      the introduction about how unintuitive the implication is? How
      can it be both intuitive and unintuitive?” This is a good point,
      and we will come back to it soon! But first, let’s try to prove
      this result.</p>

      <p>To prevent us from conflating the two meanings of “implies”,
      in our proof, let’s use \(\lnot P \lor Q\) instead of \(P
      \implies Q\). By inspecting the truth table, we see that the two
      are the same:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>\(P\)</th> <th>\(Q\)</th> <th>\(\lnot P\)</th> <th>\(\lnot P \lor Q\)</th> <th>\(P \implies Q\)</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>To summarize, the result we are trying to show is the
      following: Our intuitive meaning of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”,
      i.e., that from \(P\) we can derive \(Q\), is true if and only
      if the material conditional \(P \implies Q\) (which is
      equivalent to \(\lnot P \lor Q\)) is true. If you feel excited
      at this point, I think it’s a good idea to try to prove this
      result yourself.</p>

      <p>Let’s first suppose that our intuitive meaning of “if \(P\),
      then \(Q\)” is true. In other words, given \(P\), we can derive
      \(Q\). We want to show that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true. We have
      two cases, \(P\) or \(\lnot P\). Suppose first that \(P\) is
      true. Then by our assumption, we are allowed to derive \(Q\).
      Since we know that \(Q\) is true, we know that at least one of
      \(Q\) or \(\lnot P\) is true, so \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true.
      Next suppose that \(\lnot P\) is true. This case is even
      simpler: since \(\lnot P\) is already true, we know that at
      least one of \(\lnot P\) or \(Q\) is true, so \(\lnot P \lor Q\)
      is true. In either case, we have shown that \(\lnot P \lor Q\)
      is true. This completes the first direction of the proof.</p>

      <p>Next we show that if \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true, then given
      \(P\) we can derive \(Q\). So let’s suppose we are given \(P\).
      Our goal now is to show that \(Q\) is true. Can \(Q\) be false?
      Suppose for the sake of contradiction that \(Q\) is false. Then
      we have both \(P\) and \(\lnot Q\). This contradicts \(\lnot P
      \lor Q\), which states that at least one of \(\lnot P\) or \(Q\)
      is true. This contradiction shows that our assumption that \(Q\)
      is false was in error, so \(Q\) must be true. This completes the
      other direction of the proof, and hence we have the result.</p>

      <p>The above result justifies calling \(\implies\) the “implies”
      connective, and treating the sentence \(P \implies Q\) the same
      as we would the claim that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”. In a way, it
      is amazing that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” can be captured by a
      logical connective! The statement “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” at
      first seems much more fuzzy, something we use in an argument but
      that can’t be formalized so simply&mdash;something that we would
      expect depends on the <em>meanings</em> of the sentences and not
      just their truth values.</p>

      <!-- TODO: say more about how this also justifies that if we start with P, then show Q, we can conclude P implies Q. and that if we are given P and P implies Q, then we can derive Q. -->

      <!-- TODO: talk about vacuous implication; go back to how in the beginning, the confusion was specifically about how false implies everything. -->

      <h2 id="propositional-logic">Why propositional logic?
        <a href="#propositional-logic" class="heading-marker">#</a>
        <a href="#toc" class="heading-marker">↩︎</a></h2>

      <p>Now that we’ve hopefully demystified the material
      conditional, let’s zoom out a bit and look at propositional
      logic more generally. What have we accomplished? Why should we
      care?</p>

      <p>Something mathematicians love to do is to discover and talk
      about recursive things like
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci
      sequence</a>. If you reflect for a moment, you will see that
      propositional logic is a striking example of recursion.
      Mathematicians have been reasoning about math and writing proofs
      for thousands of years, leading to many fascinating results
      about numbers, geometry, and equations. But one way to view
      propositional logic is that it is pointing this machinery at
      itself: we are analyzing mathematical reasoning <em>using
      mathematical reasoning</em>. This is like using a microscope not
      to study cells, but to study microscopes themselves!</p>

      <p>Why might we want to do this? Well, mathematicians are a
      weird and curious people, and delight in getting all
      self-referential and “meta” to see what happens. It’s also a
      fairly natural thought: as mathematicians, we have been
      reasoning in a particular way and have gotten used to it. It has
      become our “hammer” and we see “nails” everywhere. From this
      perspective, our own mathematical reasoning is itself just
      another mathematical object we could be analyzing using our
      existing “hammer”. But there are other reasons why studying
      mathematical reasoning using mathematical reasoning is useful.
      In math, we often want to find the negation of a complicated
      statement, or find the contrapositive of an implication, or
      perform some other operation. If we have the tools of
      propositional logic at hand, we no longer need to rely on our
      verbal ability to perform these manipulations. Instead, we can
      be on “autopilot”, simply following the formal rules of
      propositional logic. Once we invest in mathematically analyzing
      something, in a sense we get to mindlessly use that thing
      without having to pay too much attention to it every time.</p>

      <p>So how does this all connect to the material conditional?
      Well, by showing that the conditional statement is amenable to
      being summarized by a truth table, we have brought it from the
      realm of fuzzy human thought down to the realm of <em>mindless
      computational stuff</em>. By doing so, we can quickly negate or
      otherwise manipulate complicated expressions involving
      “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;” statements. This is a
      powerful ability to have when writing proofs!</p>

      <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion and flashcards
        <a href="#conclusion" class="heading-marker">#</a>
        <a href="#toc" class="heading-marker">↩︎</a></h2>

      <p>Earlier we brought up the point that the implication seems to
      be both intuitive and unintuitive, and that this seems
      contradictory. But a little reflection shows that this sort of
      thing happens all the time in math. In fact, one way of thinking
      of math is to take things that seems awfully unintuitive or
      confusing, and then stare at it in just the right way so as to
      make it totally obvious.</p>

      <p>It’s a fascinating fact that the conditional statement (and
      mathematical reasoning more generally) has such a concise formal
      description. We can easily imagine alternative worlds in which
      this was not the case, where mathematical reasoning itself is
      very complicated and messy even though the objects we study are
      simple formal systems.</p>

      <p>Finally, I know how difficult it is to learn <em>and
      retain</em> math, so I have prepared some short questions for
      you to work through to check your understanding of this post. If
      you sign up with your email address, you will get email
      reminders to review these questions in the future. Since the
      reminder emails will get more infrequent over time as your
      understanding becomes more durable (this is known
      as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
      repetition</a>), this allows you to efficiently retain your
      understanding of this post.</p>
