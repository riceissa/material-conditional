      <p>Something mathematicians love to do is to discover and talk
      about recursive things. For instance, the famous Fibonacci
      sequence \(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \ldots\) is defined as
      follows. We start with the numbers \(0\) and \(1\). Then, to
      find the next element of the sequence, we add the previous two
      elements together. So \(0+1 = 1\) is the third element. The
      fourth element is the sum of the second and third elements:
      \(1+1=2\). And then we have \(1+2=3\), \(2+3=5\), \(3+5=8\), and
      so on.</p>

      <p>This sequence is <em>recursively defined</em> because the
      sequence is defined in terms of itself: later elements are
      defined in terms of earlier elements.</p>

      <p>In this article, we will explore a striking example of
      recursion. Mathematicians have been reasoning about math and
      writing proofs for thousands of years, leading to many
      fascinating results about numbers, geometry, and equations.
      However, it turns out to be possible to point this machinery at
      itself, and to analyze mathematical reasoning using mathematical
      reasoning. This is like using a microscope not to study cells,
      but to study microscopes themselves!</p>

      <p>Why might we want to do this? Well, mathematicians are kind
      of weird and curious people, and delight in getting all
      self-referential to see what happens. It's also a fairly natural
      thought: as mathematicians, we have been reasoning in a
      particular way and gotten used to it. It has become our "hammer"
      and we see "nails" everywhere. From this perspective, our own
      mathematical reasoning is itself just another mathematical
      object we could be analyzing using our existing "hammer". Later
      on in the conclusion, I will discuss some other reasons why
      studying mathematical reasoning using mathematical reasoning is
      useful. But for now, I hope this curiosity-based reason (which
      is potentially a wild and useless idea!) is sufficient to keep
      you interested.</p>
