      <h1>Understanding the material conditional</h1>

      <h2>Introduction and audience for this piece</h2>

      <p>In this post we will explore the truth table of the material
      conditional. Students first learning formal logic or getting
      started with writing proofs are introduced to the idea of truth
      tables along with the usual logical connectives like \(\lnot\)
      (NOT), \(\land\) (AND), and \(\lor\) (OR). Everything goes well
      until the logical connective \(\implies\) (IMPLIES) is
      introduced. Why does a false statement imply everything? This is
      usually explained quite poorly, e.g., in terms of promises: a
      false antecedent means the condition of the promise never
      arises, so one automatically keeps the promise.</p>


      <p>As a beginner to math, I spent many <em>years</em> being
      confused about this. Just to give one aspect of my confusion,
      the explanation in terms of promises didn't make sense because
      it seemed suspicious that we were picking one specific way in
      which "if ..., then ..." was used in natural language and
      ignoring all the others. Why were we allowed to pick one
      specific meaning to use for "if ..., then ..."? But then again,
      I didn't have the same problem with the logical OR connective:
      it always meant the inclusive OR in math, and I was fine to
      accept that. So why was I so confused about the material
      conditional? It seemed like I was not only confused about the
      truth table, but also, in my mind, confused about <em>why</em> I
      was confused; I couldn't articulate my own confusion.</p>

      <p>Like many students of math, I eventually decided to accept
      the usual truth table without understanding it because it just
      seemed to work.</p>

      <p>Many years later, I eventually hit upon core of my confusion,
      and also a way around this confusion. This is what I'd like to
      explain in this post</p>

      <p>In keeping with the above, the audience for this post is
      someone who has written some proofs before and has seen
      propositional logic and truth tables, but who still feels
      confused why the truth table for the material conditional is the
        way it is.</p>

      <h2>Why propositional logic?</h2>

      <p>Something mathematicians love to do is to discover and talk
      about recursive things. For instance, the famous Fibonacci
      sequence \(0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, \ldots\) is defined as
      follows. We start with the numbers \(0\) and \(1\). Then, to
      find the next element of the sequence, we add the previous two
      elements together. So \(0+1 = 1\) is the third element. The
      fourth element is the sum of the second and third elements:
      \(1+1=2\). And then we have \(1+2=3\), \(2+3=5\), \(3+5=8\), and
      so on.</p>

      <p>This sequence is <em>recursively defined</em> because the
      sequence is defined in terms of itself: later elements are
      defined in terms of earlier elements.</p>

      <p>In this article, we will explore a striking example of
      recursion. Mathematicians have been reasoning about math and
      writing proofs for thousands of years, leading to many
      fascinating results about numbers, geometry, and equations.
      However, it turns out to be possible to point this machinery at
      itself, and to analyze mathematical reasoning using mathematical
      reasoning. This is like using a microscope not to study cells,
      but to study microscopes themselves!</p>

      <p>Why might we want to do this? Well, mathematicians are a
      weird and curious people, and delight in getting all
      self-referential to see what happens. It's also a fairly natural
      thought: as mathematicians, we have been reasoning in a
      particular way and gotten used to it. It has become our "hammer"
      and we see "nails" everywhere. From this perspective, our own
      mathematical reasoning is itself just another mathematical
      object we could be analyzing using our existing "hammer". Later
      on in the conclusion, I will discuss some other reasons why
      studying mathematical reasoning using mathematical reasoning is
      useful. But for now, I hope this curiosity-based reason (which
      is potentially just a wild and useless idea!) is sufficient to keep
      you interested.</p>

      <p>So how do we go about mathematically analyzing mathematical
      reasoning? As in many situations in math, it's easiest if we
      have an example to work with. Let's look at an argument showing
      that every integer (i.e., the positive and negative whole
      numbers together with zero) is exactly one of even or odd. You
      might think this is too obvious, and that's okay! The point
      right now isn't to discover <em>new</em> mathematics, but rather
      to examine the familiar in a new way. For that, an example that
      seems too simple is perfect.</p>


      <p>We can represent entire mathematical statements using letters
      like \(P, Q, R, \ldots\)&nbsp;, just like how in algebra we represent
      numbers using letters like \(a, b, c, \ldots\)&nbsp;.</p>

      <p>You are also familiar with how we can form new statements using existing statements. For example, the statement "both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true" is itself a statement. This kind of claim comes up so often that </p>

      <p>So why does the implication \(P \implies Q\) have the truth table that it does?</p>

      <p>In math, it is important to pay attention to your mental representations of things and to not conflate different things</p>

      <p>Looking at "if \(P\), then Q", we have two different interpretations/mental models of it:</p>

      <p>
        1. The mysterious new meaning textbooks are forcing on us: The logical connective \(\implies\), which turns it into a sentence with a specific truth value, described by the truth table.

        <p>A much more familiar meaning:
      2. As a rule of inference saying that once we have P, we are allowed to have Q.
      <p>
      TODO: things to add:
      - it's a fascinating fact that mathematical reasoning itself has such a concise formal description. we can easily imagine alternative worlds in which this was not the case, where mathematical reasoning itself is very complicated and messy even though the objects we study are simple formal systems.
      - we should think of it as a _theorem_ that what we think of as "if... then..." can be captured by a logical connective! this should not just be a "here's how we do things and you're gonna get used to it" thing!!!
