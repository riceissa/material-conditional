      <p>In this post we will explore the truth table of the material
      conditional. Students first learning formal logic or getting
      started with writing proofs are introduced to the idea of truth
      tables along with the usual logical connectives like \(\lnot\)
      (NOT), \(\land\) (AND), and \(\lor\) (OR). Everything goes well
      until the logical connective \(\implies\) (IMPLIES) is
      introduced. Why does a false statement imply everything? This is
      usually explained quite poorly, e.g., in terms of promises: a
      false antecedent means the condition of the promise never
      arises, so one automatically keeps the promise.</p>


      <p>As a beginner to math, I spent many <em>years</em> being
      confused about this. Just to give one aspect of my confusion,
      the explanation in terms of promises didn't make sense because
      it seemed suspicious that we were picking one specific way in
      which "if ..., then ..." was used in natural language and
      ignoring all the others. Why were we allowed to pick one
      specific meaning to use for "if ..., then ..."? But then again,
      I didn't have the same problem with the logical OR connective:
      it always meant the inclusive OR in math, and I was fine to
      accept that. So why was I so confused about the material
      conditional? It seemed like I was not only confused about the
      truth table, but also, in my mind, confused about <em>why</em> I
      was confused; I couldn't articulate my own confusion.</p>

      <p>Like many students of math, I eventually decided to accept
      the usual truth table without understanding it because it just
      seemed to work.</p>

      <p>Many years later, I eventually hit upon core of my confusion,
      and also a way around this confusion. This is what I'd like to
      explain in this post</p>

      <p>In keeping with the above, the audience for this post is
      someone who has written some proofs before and has seen
      propositional logic and truth tables, but who still feels
      confused why the truth table for the material conditional is the
        way it is.</p>


      <h2 id="material-conditional">The material conditional <a href="#material-conditional" class="heading-marker">#</a> <a href="#toc" class="heading-marker">↩︎</a></h2>

      <p>So why does the implication \(P \implies Q\) have the truth table that it does?</p>

      <p>In order to answer this question, let's think about what
      makes implication different from the other logical connectives
      like NOT, AND, and OR. In my opinion it is this difference that
      makes people so uncomfortable about the truth table for the
      implication.</p>

      <p>For a logical connective like OR, there is no debate about
      whether it can be represented as a binary operation on the truth
      values of sentences. Sure, we might debate whether our "or"
      should be inclusive or exclusive, but in either case, it is
      clear that this concept can be represented as one of two truth
        tables:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>P</th> <th>Q</th> <th>P or Q</th> <th>P xor Q</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The problem is that with the conditional statement, this is
      not obvious.</p>

      <p>In math, it is important to pay attention to your mental representations of things and to not conflate different things</p>

      <p>Looking at "if \(P\), then Q", we have two different interpretations/mental models of it:</p>

      <p>
        1. The mysterious new meaning textbooks are forcing on us: The logical connective \(\implies\), which turns it into a sentence with a specific truth value, described by the truth table.</p>

      <p>A much more familiar meaning: 2. As a rule of inference
        saying that once we have P, we are allowed to have Q.</p>

      <p>Intuitively, we think of "if P, then Q" as a rule telling us
      that whenever in an argument we've shown P to be true, then we
      also get to say that Q is true. A priori, this has very little
      to do with the statement \(P \implies Q\) as defined by the
        truth table!</p>

      <p>We should in general be suspicious of linguistic games such
      as this. Similar things happen in mathematics all the time. We
      might, for example, introduce a relation called \(\leq\) on some
      class of objects. But just because it looks like an inequality,
      we cannot assume that it is reflexive or transitive or has any
      of the properties we normally associate with an inequality
      relation! A mathematician has to think very carefully to avoid
      this kind of conflation.</p>

      <p>So, <em>are</em> these two meanings of "if P, then Q"
      related? It turns out, there is a very satisfying connection: we
      can make the inference from P to Q exactly when the statement
      \(P \implies Q\) is true. In other words, our intuitive notion
      of "if P, then Q" coincides perfectly with the truth-table
      definition of implication.</p>

      <p>"Huh?" you might say. "How could our intuitive notion
      coincide with the truth table one? Didn't we go on at length in
      the introduction about how unintuitive the implication is? How
      can it be both intuitive and unintuitive?" This is a good point,
      and we will come back to it soon! But first, let's try to prove
      this result.</p>

      <p>To help us from conflating the two meanings of "implies", in
      our proof, let's use \(\lnot P \lor Q\) instead of \(P \implies
      Q\). By inspecting the truth table, we see that the two are the
      same:</p>


      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>P</th> <th>Q</th> <th>\(\lnot P\)</th> <th>\(\lnot P \lor Q\)</th> <th>\(P \implies Q\)</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p><b>Theorem.</b> Our intuitive meaning of "if P, then Q",
      i.e., that from P we can derive Q, is true if and only if the
      material conditional \(P \implies Q\) is true.</p>

      <p><em>Proof.</em> Let's first suppose that our intuitive
      meaning of "if P, then Q" is true. In other words, given P, we
      can derive Q. We want to show that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true.
      We have two cases, \(P\) or \(\lnot P\). Suppose first that
      \(P\) is true. Then by our assumption, we are allowed to derive
      Q. Since we know that Q is true, we know that at least one of Q
      or \(\lnot P\) is true, so \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true. Next
      suppose that \(\lnot P\). This case is even simpler: since
      \(\lnot P\) is already true, we know that at least one of
      \(\lnot P\) or \(Q\) is true, so \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true. In
      either case, we have shown that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true. This
      completes this direction of the proof.</p>

      <p>Next we show that if \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true, then given P
      we can derive Q. So let's suppose we are given P. Our goal now
      is to show that Q is true. Can Q be false? Suppose for the sake
      of contradiction that Q is false. Then we have both P and
      \(\lnot Q\). This contradicts \(\lnot P \lor Q\), which states
      that at least one of \(\lnot P\) or \(Q\) is true. This
      contradiction shows that our assumption that Q is false was in
      error, so Q must be true. This completes this direction of the
        proof, and hence the result.&nbsp;\(\Box\)</p>

      <p>The above theorem justifies calling \(\implies\) the
      "implies" connective, and treating the sentence \(P \implies Q\)
      the same as we would the claim that "if P, then Q". In a way, it
      is amazing that "if P, then Q" can be captured by a logical
      connective! The statement "if P, then Q" at first seems much
      more fuzzy, something we use in an argument but that can't be
      formalized so simply.</p>

      <h2 id="propositional-logic">Why propositional logic? <a href="#propositional-logic" class="heading-marker">#</a> <a href="#toc" class="heading-marker">↩︎</a></h2>

      <p>Now that we've hopefully demystified the material
      conditional, let's zoom out a bit an look at propositional logic
      more generally. What have we accomplished? Why should we
      care?</p>

      <p>Something mathematicians love to do is to discover and talk
      about recursive things. For instance, the famous Fibonacci
      sequence .</p>

      <p>This sequence is <em>recursively defined</em> because the
      sequence is defined in terms of itself: later elements are
      defined in terms of earlier elements.</p>

      <p>In this article, we will explore a striking example of
      recursion. Mathematicians have been reasoning about math and
      writing proofs for thousands of years, leading to many
      fascinating results about numbers, geometry, and equations.
      However, it turns out to be possible to point this machinery at
      itself, and to analyze mathematical reasoning using mathematical
      reasoning. This is like using a microscope not to study cells,
      but to study microscopes themselves!</p>

      <p>Why might we want to do this? Well, mathematicians are a
      weird and curious people, and delight in getting all
      self-referential to see what happens. It's also a fairly natural
      thought: as mathematicians, we have been reasoning in a
      particular way and gotten used to it. It has become our "hammer"
      and we see "nails" everywhere. From this perspective, our own
      mathematical reasoning is itself just another mathematical
      object we could be analyzing using our existing "hammer". Later
      on in the conclusion, I will discuss some other reasons why
      studying mathematical reasoning using mathematical reasoning is
      useful. But for now, I hope this curiosity-based reason (which
      is potentially just a wild and useless idea!) is sufficient to keep
      you interested.</p>

      <p>So how do we go about mathematically analyzing mathematical
      reasoning? As in many situations in math, it's easiest if we
      have an example to work with. Let's look at an argument showing
      that every integer (i.e., the positive and negative whole
      numbers together with zero) is exactly one of even or odd. You
      might think this is too obvious, and that's okay! The point
      right now isn't to discover <em>new</em> mathematics, but rather
      to examine the familiar in a new way. For that, an example that
      seems too simple is perfect.</p>


      <p>We can represent entire mathematical statements using letters
      like \(P, Q, R, \ldots\)&nbsp;, just like how in algebra we represent
      numbers using letters like \(a, b, c, \ldots\)&nbsp;.</p>

      <p>You are also familiar with how we can form new statements using existing statements. For example, the statement "both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true" is itself a statement. This kind of claim comes up so often that </p>

      <h2>Conclusion and flashcards</h2>

      <p>This concludes our investigation into the material conditional.</p>

      <p>But that's not all! This text is written in the mnemonic medium blah blah</p>

      <p>
      TODO: things to add:
      - it's a fascinating fact that mathematical reasoning itself has such a concise formal description. we can easily imagine alternative worlds in which this was not the case, where mathematical reasoning itself is very complicated and messy even though the objects we study are simple formal systems.
      - we should think of it as a _theorem_ that what we think of as "if... then..." can be captured by a logical connective! this should not just be a "here's how we do things and you're gonna get used to it" thing!!!
