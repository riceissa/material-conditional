In the main essay I tried to exlain the material conditional to a beginner,
someone who's just getting started with writing proofs. In this appendix, I
want to drop that requirement.  I will introduce and use all of the modern
machinery and notation from mathematical logic, and will try to "cleanly"
present the material conditional amidst this landscape.  Who's even the
audience for such a piece?  I think a beginner who has completed a course on
formal logic (not even mathematical logic) could probably follow along.
Additionally, I hope this page will be interesting to people who are *writing*
about logic and trying to explain the material conditional to students. So you
could think of this appendix as a "how to explain the material conditional".

<p>
Logicians and mathematicians have developed terminology and notation that all
kind of look and seem the same, but in fact are distinct.  So the first thing I
want to do is to go through all of these.

<p>
|-

<p>
|=

<p>
=&gt;

<p>
truth vs provability

<p>
metalanguage vs object language

<p>
let's take a look at an argument. consider the following:

<p>
Bill is eating crackers or watching television (or both).<br>
Bill is not watching television.<br>
Therefore, Bill is eating crackers.

<p>
The above argument is <em>valid</em>, meaning that if the premises are assumed
to be true, then the conclusion must also be true. In other words, it is
<em>truth-preserving</em>: it may not output a true statement, but at least it
does not add more untruth to what it was given.
Ok, but how do we <em>know</em> it is a valid argument?  The specific content
about Bill does not matter, so we can replace the argument above with a
streamlined version using letters as follows:

<p>
P or Q (or both).<br>
Not-Q.<br>
Therefore, P.

<p>
How do we know that the above argument is valid? You might say, "well, it is
just obvious!"  How would you explain it to someone who is skeptical? A child?

<p>There are a few approaches to answering this question:

<p>1. you can say that this is just kind of the thing that a valid argument
looks like. this is kind of the definition of OR. you can write various rules
of inference like "if P then Q; P; therefore Q" is also valid.
this leads to a syntactic approach.  We explain what connectives and arguments
are by giving examples (phrased as "axioms" and "rules of infrence"), by
showing what you can *do* with them.
You might even show how a robot would reason about this: it could write "P or
Q" and then when it encounters "not-Q", it will cross off the "Q" and be left
with just "P", so it concludes that "P" is true.
How do we know that our rules are valid? Where do the rules come from? It turns
out that we kind of just need to have the rules "baked in" to our mind, in a
sense. If we don't, we run into an infinite regress where we can't do any logic
at all -- see Lewis Carroll's famous <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/What_the_Tortoise_Said_to_Achilles">"What
the Tortoise Said to Achilles"</a> for more.

<p>2. you can say that *whatever* P and Q happen to be (whether true or false),
in the worlds where both premises are true, the conclusion is true as well.
You're saying: it is impossible to assign any meaning or interpretation to the
sentences and have the premises be true but the conclusion be false.
This leads to a semantic approach to explanation: you explain what's valid by
explaining what things *mean*.

<p>So why bother talking about valid arguments anyway?  That's because
"if...then..." is also a construction that shows up a lot in arguments.
Part of the function of "if...then..." is how it behaves as part of arguments.

<p>But now that we have explained that, what is the main essay trying to do?
It's trying to connect up the intuitive notion of "if...then..." with the truth
table version.  The shape this explanation takes, then, depends on what
intuitive notion the reader has.  So there are several possibilities we might
take.

<ol>
  <li>"if P then Q" means that if you start out by assuming P, then after some
    number of steps of reasoning, you can derive the fact that Q. In other
    words, it corresponds to P |- Q in our notation.
  <li>"if P then Q" is a claim within the object language of (1).  This makes
    sense since we want to use "if P then Q" within arguments that happen in
    the object language.  In propositional logic though (unlike in some
    first-order logic theories like Peano Arithmetic) there is no way to
    represent a "provability" predicate.  So how should we represent this
    formally? Well, we can introduce a placeholder logical connective called →
    that has certain properties that we associate with "if P then Q".
    If there exists a connective with the property that P |- Q if and only if
    |-P→Q, that is pretty convincing that the connective means what we want it
    to mean.  Then, "if P then Q" is the sentence P→Q inside the object
    language.
    Note that it's not even clear that such a connective can exist, so we'd
    also have to prove the existence of the connective.
  <li>Same as (2). But we proceed to characterize the connective → a bit
    differently. In particular, if we know that P→Q and also P, we want to say
    we can derive Q. Also, if we start out with P as an assumption and then can
    derive Q, we want to conclude that P→Q.  In other words, we look for a
    connective → such that the derivation rules "P, P→Q |- Q" and "if P|- Q
    then |-P→Q" hold.  As with (2), "if P then Q" corresponds to the sentence
    P→Q inside the object language.
  <li>Semantic: it's the claim that there is no way to assign a
    valuation/interpretation to sentences that makes P true and Q false. Or in
    other words, for every possible valuation, if P is true under that
    valuation then Q is also true.  In our notation that becomes P |= Q.
  <li>As P→Q where → is a connective such that P|=Q iff |=P→Q
  <li>As P→Q where → is a connective such that "P,P→Q |= Q" and "if P |= Q then
    |= P→Q" hold.
</ol>

(1) and (4) don't make sense since we're mixing levels.  But it turns out that
all of the others are true: we can find a single connective → such that all of
(2), (3), (5), and (6) are true.
We will give an outline of how this can be done. The interested reader can find
the details in Peter Smith's <a
href="https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf"><em>An
Introduction to Formal Logic</em> (2nd ed.)</a>, although the order in the book
will be different.  I'll provide the section numbers in the book corresponding
to our outline. So, here's the outline:

<ul>
  <li>
  <li>
  <li>
  <li>How do we know that our propositional logic even exists? Or maybe it
    trivially exists, but it outputs a bunch of nonsense, e.g. because it can
    prove any statement at all.
  <li>
  <li>
</ul>

<p>If we take the syntax first approach, we have both Modus Ponens and the
Deduction Theorem (which is not exactly a theorem since we are working in a
formal system using natural deduction rather than Hilbert-style axiomatic
system), so we have:

<p>P |- Q if and only if |- P=&gt;Q

<p>On the other hand, if we take the semantics-first approach, we can show that
P semantically entails Q if and only if P=&gt;Q is a tautology, i.e. we have:

<p>P |= Q if and only if |= P=&gt;Q

<p>Now the soundness theorem shows that anything that we said using |- can also
be said using |=. And the completeness theorem show that anything that we said
using |= can also be said using |-.  So finally, all four of the things above
coincide.  Whatever was our "intuitive" understanding of "if ... then ...", we
have connected it to the truth table meaning (|= P=&gt;Q).

<p>Why is |= P=&gt;Q the truth table meaning?

<p>The truth table is more like P,Q |= P=&gt;Q;  P,~Q |= ~(P=&gt;Q);  ~P |= P=&gt;Q.
