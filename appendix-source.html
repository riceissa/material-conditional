In the main essay I tried to exlain the material conditional to a beginner,
someone who's just getting started with writing proofs. In this appendix, I
want to drop that requirement.  I will introduce and use all of the modern
machinery and notation from mathematical logic, and will try to "cleanly"
present the material conditional amidst this landscape.  Who's even the
audience for such a piece?  I think a beginner who has completed a course on
formal logic (not even mathematical logic) could probably follow along.
Additionally, I hope this page will be interesting to people who are *writing*
about logic and trying to explain the material conditional to students. So you
could think of this appendix as a "how to explain the material conditional".

<p>
Logicians and mathematicians have developed terminology and notation that all
kind of look and seem the same, but in fact are distinct.  So the first thing I
want to do is to go through all of these.

truth vs provability

<p>
metalanguage vs object language

<p>
let's take a look at an argument. consider the following:

<p>
Bill is eating crackers or watching television (or both).<br>
Bill is not watching television.<br>
Therefore, Bill is eating crackers.

<p>
The above argument is <em>valid</em>, meaning that if the premises are assumed
to be true, then the conclusion must also be true. In other words, it is
<em>truth-preserving</em>: it may not output a true statement, but at least it
does not add more untruth to what it was given.
Ok, but how do we <em>know</em> it is a valid argument?  The specific content
about Bill does not matter, so we can replace the argument above with a
streamlined version using letters as follows:

<p>
P or Q (or both).<br>
Not-Q.<br>
Therefore, P.

<p>
How do we know that the above argument is valid? You might say, "well, it is
just obvious!"  How would you explain it to someone who is skeptical? A child?
