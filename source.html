      <p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> Thanks to Satira and Vipul Naik for comments on a
        draft version of this essay, and to Stephen for comments on an
        earlier published version.  I originally wrote this essay in 2021
        without really consulting any resources.  In 2023, I was reading Peter
        Smith’s <em>An Introduction to Formal Logic</em> (second edition) and saw
        that he had a similar explanation in one part of the book
        (<a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf#page=216">section 22.3</a>).
        I actually liked his framing better for what I was trying to do, so I
        reworked the essay to incorporate this new framing. I still think this
        essay serves as a better standalone introduction to the material
        conditional, since Smith’s explanation takes over 200 pages (it’s true
        that not all the pages are about the material conditional, but since
        the explanation is scattered throughout the book, one would have to read or
        skim most of it to get enough context and to make sure one isn’t
        missing anything). After some more looking around, I did
        however later find Smith’s
        <a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/Conditionals.pdf#page=3">“&thinsp;‘If’ and ‘\(\supset\)’&thinsp;”</a>
        which has a fairly self-contained explanation inside the box on page 3.
        (Apparently this PDF handout was
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100713043253/http://www.logicmatters.net/ifl/other-materials/">already around</a> by 2010, back when only the first edition of the book was
        written. For some reason, this explanation of the material conditional
        which I consider the most intuitive was relegated to a handout and not
        even included as part of the book!)
        I still hope my own essay is a more accessible and relaxed exposition.
        Smith’s
        book also references Nicholas J. J. Smith’s <em>Logic: The Laws of
        Truth</em>, which has a similar (but less rigorous) explanation in section
        6.3.2 (and that same line of argument is in the first edition of Peter
        Smith’s book, at the beginning of section 15.2, and also appears in
        section 19.2 of the second edition).</p>

          There’s a variety of notations here, e.g., \(\sim\) for “not” and
          \(\&amp;\) for “and”. Some other variants for \(\rightarrow\) include \(\!\implies\!\) and \(\supset\).&nbsp;<a href="#footnote-connectives-notation-ref" class="footnote-arrow">&#8617;</a>

          This footnote is for readers who are curious about this distinction.
          If you don’t care about the distinction, you are free to skip this
          footnote; it won’t affect your comprehension of the rest of the
          essay.
      The basic idea of the distinction is that an implication is supposedly a
      meta-linguistic
      statement involving quoted versions of propositions.  For example,
      we might say that “The Moon is made of cheese” implies “\(1 + 1 = 3\)”.
      It would feel ungrammatical to use unquoted versions of the two involved
      propositions, i.e., to say that
      the Moon is made of cheese implies \(1 + 1 = 3\).
      On the other hand, a conditional statement is made inside
      the object-language and uses unquoted versions of the two involved
      propositions; it’s simply a what is called a <em>connective</em>, like
      “and” and “or”. So we would say that if the Moon
      is made of cheese, then \(1 + 1 = 3\), rather than saying that
      if “the Moon is made of cheese” then “\(1 + 1 = 3\)”.
      However, other authors elide this
      distinction and use “material conditional” and “material implication”
      interchangeably.
      In mathematical logic, <em>is</em> an actually
      important distinction
      between the material conditional and semantic consequence,
      where the latter is meta-linguistic and is denoted
      by the symbol \(\models\).
      For these reasons, to avoid confusion it is best to use only
      the terms “material conditional” and “semantic consequence”, as
      these have unambiguous meanings.

        <li id="footnote-dependence">Somewhat
      technically: if \(f\) is a function taking two inputs such that
      there exists another two-input function \(g\) as well as a
      one-input function \(h\) such that \(f(x,y) = g(h(x), h(y))\) for
      all inputs \(x\) and \(y\), then we can say that \(f\) depends
      only on the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(h\)-values</span> of the inputs&mdash;there’s some other function
      \(g\) that does exactly that \(f\) accomplishes, but only using the
      <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(h\)-values</span>!&nbsp;<a href="#footnote-dependence-ref" class="footnote-arrow">&#8617;</a>

        <li id="footnote-intuitive">
          Some books use \(P \rightarrow Q\) to initially mean the intuitive notion of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”.

          So there's two ways to approach what '\(\rightarrow\)' means. One way
          is to define it according to the truth table, then show that "\(P
          \rightarrow Q\)" matches that "intuitive" meaning of "if P, then Q"
          (i.e. a statement following MP and CP). That's what I was trying to
          get at there, by defining "\(P \rightarrow Q\)" as the same as
          "\(\lnot P\lor Q\)" (but then not using the former notation because
          it seemed confusing). The other way is to let "\(P \rightarrow Q\)"
          be a connective that obeys MP and CP (i.e. we define
          '\(\rightarrow\)' to mean the intuitive "if ... then ..."), then show
          that this has a truth table equivalent to "\(\lnot P\lor Q\)".

          - there's a bit of a tricky thing going on here where some books use
          \(\rightarrow\) to mean the intuitive conditional, and then show that
          \(\rightarrow\) works the same as not-p-or-q. whereas other books
          just define \(\rightarrow\) to be the material conditional, and then
          they try to show that \(\rightarrow\) is the same as the intuitive
          "if...then...". maybe mention this in like a footnote.

        <li id="footnote-rigid">
          This whole result comes about because classical logic is “rigid” in
          some sense.&nbsp;<a href="#footnote-rigid-ref" class="footnote-arrow">&#8617;</a>
        </li>

        <li id="footnote-alt-proof">You might say that in the above proof, at
          the step where we ask
      whether we could say that \(1+1\ne 3\) (\(\lnot Q\)), that of course we
      could. That is also a valid approach. If you want to continue the proof
      that way, we have that the Moon is made of cheese (\(P\)); \(1+1\ne 3\)
      (\(\lnot Q\)); and “the Moon is not made of cheese or \(1+1=3\)”
      (\(\lnot P \lor Q\)). But the first two of these directly contradict the
      third. So we have a contradiction. And
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion">from a contradiction we can derive anything</a>,
      including that \(1+1=3\).&nbsp;<a href="#footnote-alt-proof-ref" class="footnote-arrow">&#8617;</a>

          From the Preface of Paul Halmos’s book <em>Naive Set Theory</em>:
          “The student’s task in learning set theory is to steep
          himself in unfamiliar but essentially shallow generalities
          till they become so familiar that they can be used
          with almost no conscious effort. In other words, general
          set theory is pretty trivial stuff really, but, if
          you want to be a mathematician, you need some, and
          here it is; read it, absorb it, and forget it.”&nbsp;<a href="#footnote-halmos-ref" class="footnote-arrow">&#8617;</a>
