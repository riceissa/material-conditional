          This whole result comes about because classical logic is “rigid” in
          some sense.&nbsp;<a href="#footnote-rigid-ref" class="footnote-arrow">&#8617;</a>

        <li id="footnote-alt-proof">You might say that in the above proof, at
          the step where we ask
      whether we could say that \(1+1\ne 3\) (\(\lnot Q\)), that of course we
      could. That is also a valid approach. If you want to continue the proof
      that way, we have that the Moon is made of cheese (\(P\)); \(1+1\ne 3\)
      (\(\lnot Q\)); and “the Moon is not made of cheese or \(1+1=3\)”
      (\(\lnot P \lor Q\)). But the first two of these directly contradict the
      third. So we have a contradiction. And
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion">from a contradiction we can derive anything</a>,
      including that \(1+1=3\).&nbsp;<a href="#footnote-alt-proof-ref" class="footnote-arrow">&#8617;</a>

          From the Preface of Paul Halmos’s book <em>Naive Set Theory</em>:
          “The student’s task in learning set theory is to steep
          himself in unfamiliar but essentially shallow generalities
          till they become so familiar that they can be used
          with almost no conscious effort. In other words, general
          set theory is pretty trivial stuff really, but, if
          you want to be a mathematician, you need some, and
          here it is; read it, absorb it, and forget it.”&nbsp;<a href="#footnote-halmos-ref" class="footnote-arrow">&#8617;</a>
