      It can be shown that \(\operatorname{sgn}(xy) =
      \operatorname{sgn}(x)\operatorname{sgn}(y)\), so the value of
      \(f\) depends only on the sign of the inputs.<sup><a href="#footnote-dependence" id="footnote-dependence-ref">3</a></sup>  This is analogous
      to how the “or” connective depends only on the truth values of the
      input statements. (This is sometimes expressed by saying that the “or”
      connective is <em>truth-functional</em>. The term “truth-functional”
      comes from the fact that the connective is a function of the truth
      values, i.e., depends only on the truth values.)
      On the other hand, the value of \(g\) depends
      on the actual values of the inputs, not just the sign.
      To see this, consider how \(g(-2,3) = 1\) but \(g(-3,2) = -1\);
      if \(g\) depended only on the sign of the inputs,
      both of these would be the same value.
      This behavior of \(g\) is
      despite the fact that \(g\) only takes on values in “sign space”, i.e.,
      the set \(\{-1,0,1\}\). In an
      analogous way, a compound statement involving two other statements may
      depend on just the truth values of the input statements, or it
      may depend more specifically on the contents of the input
      statements&mdash;what those statements are
      actually <em>saying</em>&mdash;despite the fact that the
      compound statement itself has a definite truth value.</p>

      <p>A logical connective can only be represented in a truth table
      if it depends solely on the truth values of the inputs. This is
      because the rows of the truth table alternate between all the
      permutations of <em>truth values</em> that the input sentences
      can have, without reference to what those sentences are saying.
      So at the moment it is not clear whether the conditional
      statement can actually be represented in a truth table.</p>

      <p>We can make the above point in a slightly different way: As
      humans, we tend to <em>conflate</em> similar-seeming things in
      order to simplify our thinking. But in math, it is important to
      pay attention to one’s mental representations of things and to
      not conflate things that are actually meaningfully distinct.
      This sort of thing happens in mathematics all the time. We
      might, for example, introduce a relation called \(\leq\) on some
      class of objects. But just because it looks like an inequality,
      we cannot assume that it is reflexive or transitive or has any
      of the properties we normally associate with an inequality
      relation! A mathematician has to think very carefully to avoid
      this kind of conflation.</p>

      <p>Looking at the statement “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”, we currently
      have two different mental models of it:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The mysterious new meaning textbooks are forcing on us:
        the logical connective \(\rightarrow\), which takes two sentences
        and turns them into a third sentence with a specific truth
        value, as governed by the truth table.</li>

        <li>A much more familiar meaning: a statement governed by
          certain rules of inference.  In particular, the way we use “if
          \(P\), then \(Q\)” is that if we know that
          “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is true and \(P\) is true, then we are
          allowed to also say that \(Q\) is true
          (this is called
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens"><em>modus ponens</em></a>).
          Furthermore, the way we show that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is
          true is by supposing that \(P\) is true, then doing some
          deductions to show that \(Q\) is true (this is called a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_proof">conditional proof</a>).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Intuitively&mdash;as well as when writing mathematical
      proofs&mdash;we
      think of (and interact with) “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” in the sense (2)
      given above. That is, a conditional statement is something that we
      create via a conditional proof and make use of via <em>modus
      ponens</em>. <em>A priori</em>, this has very little to do with
      the statement \(P \rightarrow Q\) as defined by the truth table! This
      is just another way of stating that we aren’t sure yet whether our
      intuitive notion of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” can be represented in a
      truth table.</p>

      <p>This is the core of what makes the material conditional far
      more confusing than the other logical connectives, so let me
      emphasize the point by saying: the only reason you find
      the material conditional hard to grok is that you <em>already have
      opinions about it</em>.  If we had defined an entirely new
      connective called \(\star\) and said that \(P\star Q\) is false
      if \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false and is true otherwise, you
      wonder why \(\star\) is an interesting connective to
      study, but you wouldn’t be thinking it is <em>unintuitive</em>.
      To put it another way, something can only be <em>unintuitive</em>
      when you already have pre-existing intuitions about the thing.
      The goal here is to pinpoint this intuition (as we have done above)
      and to compare it with the new definition.</p>

      <p>So, <em>are</em> these two meanings of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”
      related? It turns out, there is a very satisfying but surprising connection: they
      are exactly the same. That’s right, our
      intuitive notion of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” coincides perfectly
      with the truth-table definition of the conditional!</p>

      <p>“Huh?” you might say. “How could our intuitive notion
      coincide with the truth table one? Didn’t we go on at length in
      the introduction about how unintuitive the conditional statement is? How
      can it be both intuitive and unintuitive?” This is a good point,
      and we will come back to it <a href="#conclusion">soon</a>!
      But first, I will make a few points about logic and then
      we will try to prove this result.</p>

      <h2 id="three-rules">Three rules of logic
        <a href="#three-rules" title="Link to this section" class="heading-marker">#</a>
        <a href="#toc" title="Go back to the table of contents" class="heading-marker">&#8617;</a></h2>

      <p>To follow along with the proof in the next section, it will be
      important to be familiar with a few rules of logic.  In fact,
      you may already be familiar with these rules.  These are not
      the only rules of logic, but they are the ones that are particularly
      important for understanding the rest of this essay.</p>

      <p>The first is called the <em>law of excluded middle</em>.  It
      states that every sentence is true or false.  In other words,
      given any statement \(P\), we can claim \(P \lor \lnot P\).
      While in natural language there are many sentences (such as questions
      or commands) that don’t have a truth value, it is reasonable
      to say that at least in mathematics, all sentences are either
      true or false.  That being said,
      this law is somewhat controversial even within mathematics;
      the thought goes that
      perhaps a statement may be neither true nor false, and its
      truth or falsity may be forever unknown. Despite this,
      most mathematicians accept this law, and I hope you find it at least
      more acceptable than the truth table of the material conditional.</p>

      <p>The second is called <em>proof by contradiction</em>.  This rule says
      that when trying to prove a statement \(P\), it is valid to suppose that
      \(P\) is false, and see what happens.  If you happen to reach a
      contradiction (that is, you show that \(Q \land \lnot Q\) for some
      statement \(Q\)), then you get to say that the assumption that \(P\) is
      false was in error, and conclude that \(P\) must be true after all.
      This rule makes sense given the law of excluded middle: either \(P\)
      is true or \(P\) is false, and we just showed that \(P\) cannot be
      false, so it must be true.</p>

      <p>The third is called the <em>principle of explosion</em>.  This
      rule states that if we ever show that some statement \(P\) is
      both true and false, i.e., if we ever show \(P \land \lnot P\),
      then we can conclude anything at all.  To see why this is a
      reasonable rule, suppose that both \(P\) and \(\lnot P\) are
      true.  We will show that an arbitrary statement \(Q\) must
      be true.  Since \(P\) is true, it must be the case that
      at least one of \(P\) or \(Q\) is true, i.e., \(P \lor Q\)
      is true.  But since \(\lnot P\) is also true, that is, \(P\)
      is false, the first alternative in \(P \lor Q\) cannot hold,
      so we conclude that \(Q\) is true.  This argument may seem
      ridiculous, but it is ridiculous only because our starting assumption,
      that \(P\) is both true and false, was itself ridiculous.  Logic should
      be thought of as a machine that never <em>introduces</em> errors;
      but if you start out by assuming some erroneous notion, then
      logic won’t help you become less wrong.  The moral here is that
      if your logical system ever derives a contradiction, then it
      is worthless because it can then prove anything at all.</p>

      <p>Now we are finally ready to prove that the two meanings of
      “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” coincide. To prevent us from conflating
      the two meanings of the
      conditional, let’s use \(\lnot P \lor Q\) instead of \(P
      \rightarrow Q\). By inspecting the truth table, we see that the two
      are the same:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>\(P\)</th> <th>\(Q\)</th> <th>\(\lnot P\)</th> <th>\(\lnot P \lor Q\)</th> <th>\(P \rightarrow Q\)</th></tr>

          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>To summarize, the result we are trying to show is the
      following: Our intuitive meaning of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”
      (i.e., a sentence obeying both <em>modus ponens</em> and
      conditional proof) is true if and only
      if the material conditional \(P \rightarrow Q\) (which is
      equivalent to \(\lnot P \lor Q\)) is true.<sup><a href="#footnote-intuitive" id="footnote-intuitive-ref">4</a></sup> If you feel excited
      at this point, I think it’s a good idea to try to prove this
      result yourself.  Pause reading here if you want to attempt
      a proof.</p>

      <p>Let’s first suppose that our intuitive meaning of “if \(P\),
      then \(Q\)” is true. We want to show that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is
      true. By the law of excluded middle, we have two cases,
      \(P\) or \(\lnot P\). Suppose first that
      \(P\) is true. Then by <em>modus ponens</em>, we are allowed to
      derive \(Q\). Since we know that \(Q\) is true, we know that at
      least one of \(Q\) or \(\lnot P\) is true, so \(\lnot P \lor Q\)
      is true. Next suppose that \(\lnot P\) is true. This case is even
      simpler: since \(\lnot P\) is already true, we know that at least
      one of \(\lnot P\) or \(Q\) is true, so \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is
      true. In either case, we have shown that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is
      true. This completes the first direction of the proof.</p>

      <p>Next we show that if \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true, then our
      intuitive meaning of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is true. So suppose
      that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true. To show that “if \(P\), then
      \(Q\)” is true, we will assume that \(P\) is true and then (through a
      chain of deductions) show that \(Q\) is true.  In other words, we
      will do a conditional proof.  So let’s suppose
      that \(P\) is true. Our goal now is to show that \(Q\) is true.
      Can \(Q\) be false? Suppose for the sake of contradiction that
      \(Q\) is false. Then we have both \(P\) and \(\lnot Q\). This
      contradicts \(\lnot P \lor Q\), which states that at least one of
      \(\lnot P\) or \(Q\) is true. This contradiction shows that our
      assumption that \(Q\) is false was in error, so \(Q\) must be
      true. By conditional proof, this shows that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”
      is true. This completes the other direction of the proof, and
      hence we have the result.</p>

      <p>The above result justifies calling \(\rightarrow\) the
      “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;” or conditional
      connective, and treating the sentence \(P \rightarrow Q\) the same
      as we would the claim that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”. In a way, it
      is amazing that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” can be captured by a
      logical connective! The statement “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” at
      first seems much more fuzzy, something we use in an argument but
      that can’t be formalized so simply&mdash;something that we would
      expect depends on the <em>meanings</em> of the sentences and not
      just their truth values.<sup><a href="#footnote-rigid" id="footnote-rigid-ref">5</a></sup></p>

      <p>Another way to view the result we proved is that if we add an
      initially meaning-less symbol
      “\(\rightarrow\)” to our notation and all we know is that it obeys <em>modus
      ponens</em> and conditional proof, then our new symbol <em>must</em> be
      truth-functional, and its truth table is that of the material
      conditional.</p>

      <h2 id="alt-proof">An alternative proof
        <a href="#alt-proof" title="Link to this section" class="heading-marker">#</a>
        <a href="#toc" title="Go back to the table of contents" class="heading-marker">&#8617;</a></h2>

      <p>There is an alternative, more hands-on proof. I’d like to explain it
      because I think it makes the especially counter-intuitive rows of the
      truth table make more sense.</p>

      <p>We want to show that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is true if and only if
      \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true.  We have four cases,
      corresponding to the four rows of the truth table:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Suppose first that both \(P\) and \(Q\) are true.  In this case,
        \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true, so we want to show that
        “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is also true.  We do this via conditional
        proof.  Suppose that \(P\) is true; our goal is to show that
        \(Q\) is also true.  But by assumption, \(Q\) is true!  So this
        concludes the conditional proof and shows that
        “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is true.</li>

        <li>Now suppose that \(P\) is true and \(Q\) is false. In this case,
        \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is false, so we must show that
        “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is also false.  To do this, we will do a
        proof by contradiction.  Suppose for the sake of contradiction
        that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is true.  Then since \(P\) is true,
        by <em>modus ponens</em> we would have \(Q\).  But this is
        absurd, since \(Q\) is by assumption false.  This contradiction
        shows that in fact “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” must be false.</li>

        <li>Now suppose that \(P\) is false and \(Q\) is true. In this case,
        \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true, so we will show that
        “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is also true.  We use conditional proof.
        Suppose that \(P\) is true.  By assumption, \(Q\) is true.
        So this shows that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”.</li>

        <li>Finally, suppose that both \(P\) and \(Q\) are false. Here,
        \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true, so we must show that
        “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is also true.  We again use conditional
        proof. Suppose that \(P\) is true.  But we assumed at the start
        that \(P\) is false. So \(P\) is both true and false,
        and by the principle of explosion, we have \(Q\). (It does
        not matter that we know \(Q\) to be false from the beginning.)
        This completes the conditional proof, and we conclude that
        “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is true.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>In all cases, we have shown that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) and
      “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” have the same truth value, so this
      shows that they are identical.</p>

      <p>You may find the proof unconvincing. For instance, in cases (1)
      and (3), while we did suppose that \(P\) is true and then go on to
      demonstrate that \(Q\) is true, it’s not as if \(Q\) was true
      <em>because of</em> \(P\). Instead, \(Q\) was already true by
      assumption from the start!  So perhaps you are doubting whether
      conditional proofs are valid.</p>


      <p>This proof may seem
      tedious to read, but it has the virtue of being more concrete: each case
      corresponds to a specific row of the truth table.  This means that
      if we are confused about a particular row of the truth table, then
      we only need to examine that specific case.  For example, take the
      example sentence “if the Moon is made of cheese, then \(1+1=3\)”
      that we have been using throughout this essay.  Why is it true?
      It corresponds to the fourth case of the proof.  The reasoning
      here, from “within the logic”, goes like this: if the Moon is made of
      cheese, then, well, it’s <em>not</em> made of cheese, so supposing that
      it <em>is</em> made of cheese is absurd.  This means we’ve gotten
      ourselves into trouble and all logic breaks down, so in particular
      \(1+1=3\).</p>



      <h2 id="vacuous-truth">Vacuous truth
        <a href="#vacuous-truth" title="Link to this section" class="heading-marker">#</a>
        <a href="#toc" title="Go back to the table of contents" class="heading-marker">&#8617;</a></h2>

      <p>A conditional where the antecedent is false is called a
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous truth</a>.
      So the sentence “if the Moon is made of cheese, then \(1+1=3\)” is
      vacuously true.

      Let’s return to the example from the start of this essay, “if
      the Moon is made of cheese, then \(1+1=3\)”.
      Can we now make sense of this statement given the
      result we showed above? One approach is to run through part of
      the proof again, but using the concrete statements that we have
      instead of (or in addition to) the letters \(P\) and
      <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(Q\).</span>
      We know that the Moon is
      not made of cheese (\(\lnot P\)), so “the Moon is not made of cheese or
      \(1+1=3\)” (\(\lnot P \lor Q\)) is true. But now suppose in addition that the
      Moon <em>were</em> made of cheese (\(P\)). Could we now say that
      \(1+1\ne 3\) (\(\lnot Q\))? If we did, this would
      contradict what we said
      above, that either the Moon is not made of cheese or
      \(1+1=3\) (\(\lnot P \lor Q\)).
      So we have no choice but to conclude that \(1+1=3\) (\(Q\)). But now
      notice that we started with the assumption that the Moon is made
      of cheese <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(\(P\)),</span> and derived \(1+1=3\) (\(Q\)),
      so we have shown “if the Moon
      is made of cheese, then \(1+1=3\)” (if \(P\), then \(Q\))!<sup><a href="#footnote-alt-proof" id="footnote-alt-proof-ref">6</a></sup></p>

      <p>talk about how, since the premise of a vacuous implication will never show up, it’s not like we can conclude anything absurd anyway.</p>

      <p>false implies anything is basically the statement-level version
      of the principle of explosion.</p>

      <p>Now that we’ve hopefully demystified the material
      conditional, let’s zoom out a bit and look at propositional
      logic more generally. What have we accomplished? Why should we
      care?</p>

      <p>Propositional logic is a striking example of recursion.
      Mathematicians have been reasoning about math and writing proofs
      for thousands of years, leading to many fascinating results
      about numbers, geometry, and equations. But one way to view
      propositional logic is that it is pointing this machinery at
      itself: we are analyzing mathematical reasoning <em>using
      mathematical reasoning</em>. This is like using a microscope not
      to study cells, but to study microscopes themselves!</p>

      <p>Why might we want to do this? Well, mathematicians are a
      weird and curious people, and delight in getting all
      self-referential and “meta” to see what happens. It’s also a
      fairly natural thought: as mathematicians, we have been
      reasoning in a particular way and have gotten used to it. It has
      become our “hammer” and we see “nails” everywhere. From this
      perspective, our own mathematical reasoning is itself just
      another mathematical object we could be analyzing using our
      existing “hammer”.  We can ask questions about mathematical
      reasoning itself, like “Can all true mathematical statements be
      proved?”  Taken to the extreme, we end up with the field of
      mathematical logic.  But there is another, more mundane, reason why studying
      mathematical reasoning using mathematical reasoning is useful.
      In math, we often want to find the negation of a complicated
      statement, or find the contrapositive of a conditional statement, or
      perform some other operation on complicated sentences. If we have the tools of
      propositional logic at hand, we no longer need to rely on our
      verbal dexterity to perform these manipulations. Instead, we can
      be on “autopilot”, simply following the formal rules of
      propositional logic. Once we invest in mathematically analyzing
      something, in a sense we get to mindlessly use that thing
      without having to pay too much attention to it every time.</p>

      <p>So how does this all connect to the material conditional?
      By showing that the conditional statement is amenable to
      being summarized by a truth table, we have brought it from the
      realm of fuzzy human thought down to the realm of <em>mindless
      computational stuff</em>. By doing so, we can quickly negate or
      otherwise manipulate complicated expressions involving
      “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;” statements. This is a
      powerful ability to have when writing and reasoning about proofs!</p>

      <p>Continuing with the microscope analogy, it is as if by studying
      microscopes using a microscope, we can improve our own microscopes
      to be more efficient.

      [That's a quite interesting point... I do admit that some people
      will be similar to you. And I do agree that learning about
      propositional logic will help people write more correct
      mathematical proofs (this is kind of what I was getting at in the
      "Why propositional logic?" section).]

      <p>In this essay we showed that if one accepts some background
      rules for logic (as discussed in the <a href="#three-rules">Three
      rules of logic</a> section) and also accepts that the “if&nbsp;&hellip;,
      then&nbsp;&hellip;” statement in math obeys <em>modus ponens</em>
      and conditional proof, then one is forced to having a
      truth-functional conditional with the ordinary truth table. This
      does not say anything about how conditional statements are used
      in ordinary English, but one can at least be confident that when
      doing mathematics, the “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;” one
      has been using in proofs is the same as the truth table
      version.</p>

      <p>Earlier we brought up the point that the conditional seems to
      be both intuitive and unintuitive, and that this seems
      contradictory. But a little reflection shows that this sort of
      thing happens all the time in math. In fact, one way of thinking
      of math is to take things that seem awfully unintuitive or
      confusing, and then stare at them in just the right way so as to
      make them totally obvious.</p>

      <p>It’s a fascinating fact that the conditional statement (and
      mathematical reasoning more generally) has such a concise formal
      description. We can easily imagine alternative worlds in which
      this was not the case, where mathematical reasoning itself is
      very complicated and messy even though the objects we study are
      simple formal systems.</p>

      <p>I don’t want to give the impression that I’ve covered
      everything there is to know about conditionals&mdash;far from it.
      I do think that I said about as much as what an “intro to proofs”
      book would say on the topic, in a hopefully more convincing
      manner.  Those interested in reading more about conditionals can
      find a vast literature&mdash;on the philosophical aspects,
      alternative conditionals, and alternative logics.
      And if you are interested in learning more about how to treat
      math as a mechanical thing, as an object of study in itself
      (rather than studying other mathematical objects like spheres
      or numbers), then this line of thought is taken much farther in
      mathematical logic.
      But for those who are excited to jump
      into proof-based mathematics but were unconvinced by the usual
      explanations&mdash;and I was like this too&mdash;I hope this essay is
      enough for you to be convinced that the material conditional makes
      sense.  I sure wish I had stumbled onto this explanation much
      sooner.  As Paul Halmos has said about set theory, now that you
      have read this, you can safely forget about it,<sup><a href="#footnote-halmos" id="footnote-halmos-ref">7</a></sup> in some sense
      (though I do hope you will continue to review the flashcards).</p>

      whole essay:</p>

      <p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> Thanks to Satira and Vipul Naik for comments on a
        draft version of this essay, and to Stephen for comments on an
        earlier published version.  I originally wrote this essay in 2021
        without really consulting any resources.  In 2023, I was reading Peter
        Smith’s <em>An Introduction to Formal Logic</em> (second edition) and saw
        that he had a similar explanation in one part of the book
        (<a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf#page=216">section 22.3</a>).
        I actually liked his framing better for what I was trying to do, so I
        reworked the essay to incorporate this new framing. I still think this
        essay serves as a better standalone introduction to the material
        conditional, since Smith’s explanation takes over 200 pages (it’s true
        that not all the pages are about the material conditional, but since
        the explanation is scattered throughout the book, one would have to read or
        skim most of it to get enough context and to make sure one isn’t
        missing anything). After some more looking around, I did
        however later find Smith’s
        <a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/Conditionals.pdf#page=3">“&thinsp;‘If’ and ‘\(\supset\)’&thinsp;”</a>
        which has a fairly self-contained explanation inside the box on page 3.
        (Apparently this PDF handout was
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100713043253/http://www.logicmatters.net/ifl/other-materials/">already around</a> by 2010, back when only the first edition of the book was
        written. For some reason, this explanation of the material conditional
        which I consider the most intuitive was relegated to a handout and not
        even included as part of the book!)
        I still hope my own essay is a more accessible and relaxed exposition.
        Smith’s
        book also references Nicholas J. J. Smith’s <em>Logic: The Laws of
        Truth</em>, which has a similar (but less rigorous) explanation in section
        6.3.2 (and that same line of argument is in the first edition of Peter
        Smith’s book, at the beginning of section 15.2, and also appears in
        section 19.2 of the second edition).</p>

          There’s a variety of notations here, e.g., \(\sim\) for “not” and
          \(\&amp;\) for “and”. Some other variants for \(\rightarrow\) include \(\!\implies\!\) and \(\supset\).&nbsp;<a href="#footnote-connectives-notation-ref" class="footnote-arrow">&#8617;</a>

          This footnote is for readers who are curious about this distinction.
          If you don’t care about the distinction, you are free to skip this
          footnote; it won’t affect your comprehension of the rest of the
          essay.
      The basic idea of the distinction is that an implication is supposedly a
      meta-linguistic
      statement involving quoted versions of propositions.  For example,
      we might say that “The Moon is made of cheese” implies “\(1 + 1 = 3\)”.
      It would feel ungrammatical to use unquoted versions of the two involved
      propositions, i.e., to say that
      the Moon is made of cheese implies \(1 + 1 = 3\).
      On the other hand, a conditional statement is made inside
      the object-language and uses unquoted versions of the two involved
      propositions; it’s simply a what is called a <em>connective</em>, like
      “and” and “or”. So we would say that if the Moon
      is made of cheese, then \(1 + 1 = 3\), rather than saying that
      if “the Moon is made of cheese” then “\(1 + 1 = 3\)”.
      However, other authors elide this
      distinction and use “material conditional” and “material implication”
      interchangeably.
      In mathematical logic, <em>is</em> an actually
      important distinction
      between the material conditional and semantic consequence,
      where the latter is meta-linguistic and is denoted
      by the symbol \(\models\).
      For these reasons, to avoid confusion it is best to use only
      the terms “material conditional” and “semantic consequence”, as
      these have unambiguous meanings.

      all inputs \(x\) and \(y\), then we can say that \(f\) depends
      only on the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(h\)-values</span> of the inputs&mdash;there’s some other function

          Some books use \(P \rightarrow Q\) to initially mean the intuitive notion of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”.

          So there's two ways to approach what '\(\rightarrow\)' means. One way
          is to define it according to the truth table, then show that "\(P
          \rightarrow Q\)" matches that "intuitive" meaning of "if P, then Q"
          (i.e. a statement following MP and CP). That's what I was trying to
          get at there, by defining "\(P \rightarrow Q\)" as the same as
          "\(\lnot P\lor Q\)" (but then not using the former notation because
          it seemed confusing). The other way is to let "\(P \rightarrow Q\)"
          be a connective that obeys MP and CP (i.e. we define
          '\(\rightarrow\)' to mean the intuitive "if ... then ..."), then show
          that this has a truth table equivalent to "\(\lnot P\lor Q\)".

          - there's a bit of a tricky thing going on here where some books use
          \(\rightarrow\) to mean the intuitive conditional, and then show that
          \(\rightarrow\) works the same as not-p-or-q. whereas other books
          just define \(\rightarrow\) to be the material conditional, and then
          they try to show that \(\rightarrow\) is the same as the intuitive
          "if...then...". maybe mention this in like a footnote.

        <li id="footnote-alt-proof">You might say that in the above proof, at
          the step where we ask
      whether we could say that \(1+1\ne 3\) (\(\lnot Q\)), that of course we
      could. That is also a valid approach. If you want to continue the proof
      that way, we have that the Moon is made of cheese (\(P\)); \(1+1\ne 3\)
      (\(\lnot Q\)); and “the Moon is not made of cheese or \(1+1=3\)”
      (\(\lnot P \lor Q\)). But the first two of these directly contradict the
      third. So we have a contradiction. And
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion">from a contradiction we can derive anything</a>,
