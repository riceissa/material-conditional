      <p>In this essay I will explain the truth table of
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Material_conditional">material
      conditional</a> (i.e., the “if&nbsp;&hellip;,
      then&nbsp;&hellip;” statement used in math). Students first
      learning formal logic or getting started with writing proofs are
      introduced to the idea of truth tables along with the usual
      logical connectives like \(\lnot\) (NOT), \(\land\) (AND), and
      \(\lor\) (OR). Everything goes well until the logical connective
      \(\implies\) (IMPLIES) for the material conditional is
      introduced. Why does a false statement imply anything? This is
      usually explained quite poorly, e.g., in terms of promises. For
      instance, “if the Moon is made of cheese, then \(1+1=3\)” is
      interpreted as the promise that \(1+1=3\) as long as
      the Moon is made of cheese; but since the Moon is not made of
      cheese, we can’t say that the promise was broken, and so we say
      that the promise was kept. In this way, a false antecedent (the
      part of the conditional appearing after “if&nbsp;&hellip;”)
      means the condition of the promise never arises, so one
      automatically keeps the promise.</p>

      <p>As a beginner to math, I spent many <em>years</em> being
      confused about this. Just to give one aspect of my confusion,
      the explanation in terms of promises didn’t make sense because
      while it is true that one didn’t break the promise when the
      antecedent is false, it’s also not clear that one has actually
      kept the promise, or that one <em>would have</em> kept the
      promise. It also seemed suspicious that we were picking one
      specific way in which “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;” was
      used in natural language and ignoring all the others. Why were
      we allowed to pick one specific meaning to use for
      “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;”? But then again, I didn’t
      have the same problem with the logical OR connective: it always
      meant
      the <a href="https://mathworld.wolfram.com/InclusiveDisjunction.html">inclusive
      OR</a> in math, and I was fine to accept that. So why was I so
      confused about the material conditional? It seemed like I was
      not only confused about the truth table, but also, inside my own
      mind, confused about <em>why</em> I was confused&mdash;I had trouble
      articulating my own confusion.</p>

      <p>Like many students of mathematics, I eventually decided to
      accept the usual truth table without understanding it because it
      just seemed to work: it seemed to produce correct proofs, and in
      any case vacuous conditionals don’t show up all that much.
      Many years later, I eventually hit upon the
      core of my confusion, and also a way to resolve this confusion.
      This is what I’d like to explain in this essay.</p>

      <p>In keeping with the above, the audience for this essay is
      someone who has written some proofs before and has seen
      propositional logic and truth tables, but who still feels
      confused why the truth table for the material conditional is the
      way it is.</p>

      <p>One small terminological note: in this essay I use “material
      conditional”, “conditional”, and “implication” interchangeably.
      In some contexts people distinguish the
      <em>material</em> conditional from other kinds of conditionals,
      and in such places these terms can’t be used interchangeably,
      but we will not be encountering any other conditionals in this
      essay, so it is safe to switch around if one phrase sounds more
      natural than the others.  Some people also distinguish between
      conditionals and implications, but we will again elide this distinction.
      Similarly, we use “statement”, “sentence”, and “proposition”
      interchangeably.</p>

      <p>Finally, I know how difficult it is to learn <em>and
      retain</em> math, so I have prepared some short questions for
      you to answer throughout this essay to check your understanding.
      If you sign up with your email address, you will get email
      reminders to review these questions in the future. Since the
      reminder emails will get more infrequent over time as your
      understanding becomes more durable (this is known
      as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
      repetition</a>), this allows you to efficiently retain your
      understanding of the ideas in this essay.
      The short review questions appear in boxes like the following:</p>

      <orbit-reviewarea color="cyan">
        <orbit-prompt
          question="Why is an explanation of the material conditional in terms of promises not convincing?"
          answer="There are many potential answers, but here are two:

1. It's not entirely clear that the promise has been (or would have been) kept if the condition never arises.
2. It's not clear why we are allowed to take one specific ordinary usage of “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;” while ignoring all the others."
        ></orbit-prompt>
        <orbit-prompt
          question="Which kind of logical OR is the default in math?"
          answer="inclusive OR"
        ></orbit-prompt>
      </orbit-reviewarea>

      <h2 id="conditional-different">What makes the conditional different from other logical connectives?
        <a href="#conditional-different" title="Link to this section" class="heading-marker">#</a>
        <a href="#toc" title="Go back to the table of contents" class="heading-marker">&#8617;</a></h2>

      <p>So why does the conditional statement \(P \implies Q\) have
      the truth table that it does? In order to answer this question,
      let’s think about what makes implication different from the
      other logical connectives like NOT, AND, and OR. After all, we
      have no problem with the other connectives so there must
      be <em>some</em> difference we can identify. And, in my opinion,
      it is this difference that makes people so uncomfortable with
      the truth table for the conditional. If you feel so inclined, I
      think this is a good exercise to attempt before reading on. It
      will give you practice peeking into your own mind and trying to
      pinpoint a subtle distinction your mind is already making.</p>

      <p>Now, for a logical connective like OR, there is no debate
      about whether it can be represented as a binary operation on the
      truth values of sentences. Sure, we might debate whether our
      “or” should be inclusive or exclusive, but in either case, it is
      clear that this concept can be represented as one of two columns
      in a truth table:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>\(P\)</th> <th>\(Q\)</th> <th>\(P\) inclusive-or \(Q\)</th> <th>\(P\) exclusive-or \(Q\)</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>The same cannot be said for the conditional statement! It is
      true that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is a statement involving \(P\)
      and \(Q\), which we presume has some definite truth value. But is this
      statement really a function of the <em>truth values</em> of
      \(P\) and \(Q\)? Or could it depend on the <em>contents</em> of
      \(P\) and \(Q\)?</p>

      <p>Let me stress this point by bringing in an unrelated example:
      Consider two functions, \(f\) and \(g\), both defined on pairs
      of numbers. We define \(f(x,y) = \operatorname{sgn}(xy)\), where
      \(\operatorname{sgn}\) is
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_function">sign
      function</a> that returns \(1\) when a number is positive, \(0\)
      when it is the number \(0\), and \(-1\) when a number is
      negative. We define \(g(x,y) = xy\) to be the product of the two
      numbers. Thus for example \(f(-2,3) = -1\) and \(g(-2,3) = -6\).
      It can be shown that \(\operatorname{sgn}(xy) =
      \operatorname{sgn}(x)\operatorname{sgn}(y)\), so the value of
      \(f\) depends only on the sign of the inputs.<sup><a href="#footnote-dependence" id="footnote-dependence-ref">1</a></sup>  This is analogous
      to how the OR connective depends only on the truth values of the
      input statements. (This is sometimes expressed by saying that the OR
      connective is <em>truth-functional</em>. The term “truth-functional”
      comes from the fact that the connective is a function of the truth
      values, i.e., depends only on the truth values.)
      On the other hand, the value of \(g\) depends
      on the actual values of the inputs, not just the sign. In an
      analogous way, a statement involving two other statements may
      depend on just the truth values of the input statements, or it
      may depend more specifically on the contents of the input
      statements&mdash;what those statements are
      actually <em>saying</em>.</p>

      <p>A logical connective can only be represented in a truth table
      if it depends solely on the truth values of the inputs. This is
      because the rows of the truth table alternate between all the
      permutations of <em>truth values</em> that the input sentences
      can have, without reference to what those sentences are saying.
      So at the moment it is not clear whether the conditional
      statement can actually be represented in a truth table.</p>

      <p>We can make the above point in a slightly different way: As
      humans, we tend to <em>conflate</em> similar-seeming things in
      order to simplify our thinking. But in math, it is important to
      pay attention to one’s mental representations of things and to
      not conflate things that are actually meaningfully distinct.
      This sort of thing happens in mathematics all the time. We
      might, for example, introduce a relation called \(\leq\) on some
      class of objects. But just because it looks like an inequality,
      we cannot assume that it is reflexive or transitive or has any
      of the properties we normally associate with an inequality
      relation! A mathematician has to think very carefully to avoid
      this kind of conflation.</p>

      <p>Looking at the statement “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”, we currently
      have two different mental models of it:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The mysterious new meaning textbooks are forcing on us:
        the logical connective \(\implies\), which takes two sentences
        and turns them into a third sentence with a specific truth
        value, as described by the truth table.</li>

        <li>A much more familiar meaning: a statement governed by
          certain rules of inference.  In particular, the way we use “if
          \(P\), then \(Q\)” is that if we know that
          “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is true and \(P\) is true, then we are
          allowed to also say that \(Q\) is true
          (this is called
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens"><em>modus ponens</em></a>).
          Furthermore, the way we show that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is
          true is by supposing that \(P\) is true, then doing some
          deductions to show that \(Q\) is true (this is called a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_proof">conditional proof</a>).</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Intuitively&mdash;as well as when writing mathematical
      proofs&mdash;we
      think of (and interact with) “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” in the sense (2)
      given above. That is, a conditional statement is something that we
      create via a conditional proof and make use of via <em>modus
      ponens</em>. <em>A priori</em>, this has very little to do with
      the statement \(P \implies Q\) as defined by the truth table! This
      is just another way of stating that we aren’t sure yet whether our
      intuitive notion of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” can be represented in a
      truth table.</p>

      <p>So, <em>are</em> these two meanings of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”
      related? It turns out, there is a very satisfying connection: they
      are exactly the same. That’s right, our
      intuitive notion of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” coincides perfectly
      with the truth-table definition of implication!</p>

      <p>“Huh?” you might say. “How could our intuitive notion
      coincide with the truth table one? Didn’t we go on at length in
      the introduction about how unintuitive the implication is? How
      can it be both intuitive and unintuitive?” This is a good point,
      and we will come back to it <a href="#conclusion">soon</a>! But first, let’s try to prove
      this result.</p>

      <h2 id="proving">Proving that the conditional has the usual truth table</h2>

      <p>To prevent us from conflating the two meanings of the
      conditional, let’s use \(\lnot P \lor Q\) instead of \(P
      \implies Q\). By inspecting the truth table, we see that the two
      are the same:</p>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>\(P\)</th> <th>\(Q\)</th> <th>\(\lnot P\)</th> <th>\(\lnot P \lor Q\)</th> <th>\(P \implies Q\)</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>T</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>F</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>F</td> <td>F</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td> <td>T</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <p>To summarize, the result we are trying to show is the
      following: Our intuitive meaning of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”
      (i.e., a sentence obeying both <em>modus ponens</em> and
      conditional proof) is true if and only
      if the material conditional \(P \implies Q\) (which is
      equivalent to \(\lnot P \lor Q\)) is true. If you feel excited
      at this point, I think it’s a good idea to try to prove this
      result yourself.</p>

      <p>Let’s first suppose that our intuitive meaning of “if \(P\),
      then \(Q\)” is true. We want to show that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is
      true. We have two cases, \(P\) or \(\lnot P\). Suppose first that
      \(P\) is true. Then by <em>modus ponens</em>, we are allowed to
      derive \(Q\). Since we know that \(Q\) is true, we know that at
      least one of \(Q\) or \(\lnot P\) is true, so \(\lnot P \lor Q\)
      is true. Next suppose that \(\lnot P\) is true. This case is even
      simpler: since \(\lnot P\) is already true, we know that at least
      one of \(\lnot P\) or \(Q\) is true, so \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is
      true. In either case, we have shown that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is
      true. This completes the first direction of the proof.</p>

      <p>Next we show that if \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true, then our
      intuitive meaning of “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” is true. So suppose
      that \(\lnot P \lor Q\) is true. To show that “if \(P\), then
      \(Q\)” is true, we will assume that \(P\) is true and then (through a
      chain of deductions) show that \(Q\) is true. So let’s suppose
      that \(P\) is true. Our goal now is to show that \(Q\) is true.
      Can \(Q\) be false? Suppose for the sake of contradiction that
      \(Q\) is false. Then we have both \(P\) and \(\lnot Q\). This
      contradicts \(\lnot P \lor Q\), which states that at least one of
      \(\lnot P\) or \(Q\) is true. This contradiction shows that our
      assumption that \(Q\) is false was in error, so \(Q\) must be
      true. By conditional proof, this shows that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”
      is true. This completes the other direction of the proof, and
      hence we have the result.</p>

      <p>The above result justifies calling \(\implies\) the “implies”
      or conditional
      connective, and treating the sentence \(P \implies Q\) the same
      as we would the claim that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)”. In a way, it
      is amazing that “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” can be captured by a
      logical connective! The statement “if \(P\), then \(Q\)” at
      first seems much more fuzzy, something we use in an argument but
      that can’t be formalized so simply&mdash;something that we would
      expect depends on the <em>meanings</em> of the sentences and not
      just their truth values.</p>

      <p>Another way to view the result we proved is that if we add a symbol
      “\({\implies}\)” to our notation and all we know is that it obeys <em>modus
      ponens</em> and conditional proof, then our new symbol <em>must</em> be
      truth-functional, and its truth table is that of the material
      conditional.</p>

      <h2 id="alt-proof">An alternative proof</h2>

      <p>There is an alternative, more hands-on proof. I'd like to explain it
      because I think it makes the especially counter-intuitive rows of the
      truth table make more sense.</p>

      <p>Notice the symmetry: to show that \(P \implies Q\) is true, we used
      modus ponens. To show that it is false, we used conditional proof. Is
      there anything deep going on here? I'm going to bet that there is, but I
      don't even understand this myself yet.</p>

      <h2>Vacuous truth</h2>

      <p>Let’s return to the example from the start of this essay, “if
      the Moon is made of cheese, then \(1+1=3\)”. Since the
      antecedent is false, this is an example of
      a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous
      truth</a>. Can we now make sense of this statement given the
      result we showed above? One approach is to run through part of
      the proof again, but using the concrete statements that we have
      instead of (or in addition to) the letters \(P\) and
      <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(Q\).</span>
      We know that the Moon is
      not made of cheese (\(\lnot P\)), so “the Moon is not made of cheese or
      \(1+1=3\)” (\(\lnot P \lor Q\)) is true. But now suppose in addition that the
      Moon <em>were</em> made of cheese (\(P\)). Could we now say that
      \(1+1\ne 3\) (\(\lnot Q\))? If we did, this would
      contradict what we said
      above, that either the Moon is not made of cheese or
      \(1+1=3\) (\(\lnot P \lor Q\)).
      So we have no choice but to conclude that \(1+1=3\) (\(Q\)). But now
      notice that we started with the assumption that the Moon is made
      of cheese (\(P\)), and derived \(1+1=3\) (\(Q\)),
      so we have shown “if the Moon
      is made of cheese, then \(1+1=3\)” (if \(P\), then \(Q\))!<sup><a href="#footnote-alt-proof" id="footnote-alt-proof-ref">2</a></sup></p>

        <a href="#toc" title="Go back to the table of contents" class="heading-marker">&#8617;</a></h2>

      <p>Now that we’ve hopefully demystified the material
      conditional, let’s zoom out a bit and look at propositional
      logic more generally. What have we accomplished? Why should we
      care?</p>

      <p>Something mathematicians love to do is to discover and talk
      about recursive things like
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_sequence">Fibonacci
      sequence</a>. If you reflect for a moment, you will see that
      propositional logic is a striking example of recursion.
      Mathematicians have been reasoning about math and writing proofs
      for thousands of years, leading to many fascinating results
      about numbers, geometry, and equations. But one way to view
      propositional logic is that it is pointing this machinery at
      itself: we are analyzing mathematical reasoning <em>using
      mathematical reasoning</em>. This is like using a microscope not
      to study cells, but to study microscopes themselves!</p>

      <p>Why might we want to do this? Well, mathematicians are a
      weird and curious people, and delight in getting all
      self-referential and “meta” to see what happens. It’s also a
      fairly natural thought: as mathematicians, we have been
      reasoning in a particular way and have gotten used to it. It has
      become our “hammer” and we see “nails” everywhere. From this
      perspective, our own mathematical reasoning is itself just
      another mathematical object we could be analyzing using our
      existing “hammer”. But there are other reasons why studying
      mathematical reasoning using mathematical reasoning is useful.
      In math, we often want to find the negation of a complicated
      statement, or find the contrapositive of an implication, or
      perform some other operation. If we have the tools of
      propositional logic at hand, we no longer need to rely on our
      verbal ability to perform these manipulations. Instead, we can
      be on “autopilot”, simply following the formal rules of
      propositional logic. Once we invest in mathematically analyzing
      something, in a sense we get to mindlessly use that thing
      without having to pay too much attention to it every time.</p>

      <p>So how does this all connect to the material conditional?
      Well, by showing that the conditional statement is amenable to
      being summarized by a truth table, we have brought it from the
      realm of fuzzy human thought down to the realm of <em>mindless
      computational stuff</em>. By doing so, we can quickly negate or
      otherwise manipulate complicated expressions involving
      “if&nbsp;&hellip;, then&nbsp;&hellip;” statements. This is a
      powerful ability to have when writing proofs!</p>

      <p>Earlier we brought up the point that the implication seems to
      be both intuitive and unintuitive, and that this seems
      contradictory. But a little reflection shows that this sort of
      thing happens all the time in math. In fact, one way of thinking
      of math is to take things that seem awfully unintuitive or
      confusing, and then stare at them in just the right way so as to
      make them totally obvious.</p>

      <p>It’s a fascinating fact that the conditional statement (and
      mathematical reasoning more generally) has such a concise formal
      description. We can easily imagine alternative worlds in which
      this was not the case, where mathematical reasoning itself is
      very complicated and messy even though the objects we study are
      simple formal systems.</p>

      <p>I don’t want to give the impression that I’ve covered
      everything there is to know about conditionals&mdash;far from it.
      I do think that I said about as much as what an “intro to proofs”
      book would say on the topic, in a hopefully more convincing
      manner.  Those interested in reading more about conditionals can
      find a vast literature&mdash;on the philosophical aspects,
      alternative conditionals.  But for those who are excited to jump
      into proof-based mathematics (but were unconvinced by the usual
      explanations) (and I was like this too) I hope this essay is
      enough for you to be convinced that the material conditional makes
      sense.  I sure wish I had stumbled onto this explanation much
      sooner.  As Paul Halmos has said about set theory, now that you
      have read this, you can safely forget about it, in some sense
      (though I do hope you will continue to review the flashcards).</p>

      <p>Here are some final review questions, covering material throughout the
      whole essay:</p>

      <p><strong>Acknowledgments:</strong> Thanks to Satira and Vipul Naik for comments on a
        draft version of this essay.  I originally wrote this essay in 2021
        without really consulting any resources.  In 2023, I was reading Peter
        Smith’s <em>An Introduction to Formal Logic</em> (second edition) and saw
        that he had a similar explanation in one part of the book
        (<a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/IFL2_LM.pdf#page=216">section 22.3</a>).
        I actually liked his framing better for what I was trying to do, so I
        reworked the essay to incorporate this new framing. I still think this
        essay serves as a better standalone introduction to the material
        conditional, since Smith’s explanation takes over 200 pages (it’s true
        that not all the pages are about the material conditional, but since
        the explanation is scattered around the book, one would have to read or
        skim most of it to get enough context and to make sure one isn’t
        missing anything). After some more looking around, I did
        however later find Smith’s
        <a href="https://www.logicmatters.net/resources/pdfs/Conditionals.pdf#page=3">“&thinsp;‘If’ and ‘\(\supset\)’&thinsp;”</a>
        which has a fairly self-contained explanation inside the box on page 3.
        (Apparently this PDF handout was
        <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100713043253/http://www.logicmatters.net/ifl/other-materials/">already around</a> by 2010, back when only the first edition of the book was
        written. For some reason, this explanation of the material conditional
        which I consider the most intuitive was relegated to a handout and not
        even included as part of the book!)
        Smith’s
        book also references Nicholas J. J. Smith’s <em>Logic: The Laws of
        Truth</em>, which has a similar (but less rigorous) explanation in section
        6.3.2 (and that same line of argument is in the first edition of Peter
        Smith’s book, at the beginning of section 15.2, and also appears in
        section 19.2 of the second edition).</p>

      technically: if \(f\) is a function taking two inputs such that
      there exists another two-input function \(g\) as well as a
      one-input function \(h\) such that \(f(x,y) = g(h(x), h(y))\) for
      all inputs \(x\) and \(y\), then we can say that \(f\) depends
      only on the <span style="white-space: nowrap;">\(h\)-values</span> of the inputs&mdash;there’s some other function
      \(g\) that does exactly that \(f\) accomplishes, but only using the

        <li id="footnote-alt-proof">You might say that in the above proof, at
          the step where we ask
      whether we could say that \(1+1\ne 3\) (\(\lnot Q\)), that of course we
      could. That is also a valid approach. If you want to continue the proof
      that way, we have that the Moon is made of cheese (\(P\)); \(1+1\ne 3\)
      (\(\lnot Q\)); and “the Moon is not made of cheese or \(1+1=3\)”
      (\(\lnot P \lor Q\)). But the first two of these directly contradict the
      third. So we have a contradiction. And
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_explosion">from a contradiction we can derive anything</a>,
